It’s just really cool.” Reeves also talked about their characters’ <a href=# rel=noopener>bond on screen</a>, “I always thought that the connection between John Wick and Charon was special. I always said to him that people liked John Wick because he liked John Wick.”</p><p>When the news broke, Reeves and John Wick director Chad Stahelski announced that the film will be dedicated to Reddick. “We are deeply saddened and heartbroken at the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Lance Reddick. He was the consummate professional and a joy to work with,” they said. “Our love and prayers are with his wife Stephanie, his children, family and friends. We dedicate the film to his loving memory. We will miss him dearly.”</p><p>At the Los Angeles premiere at the TCL Chinese Theater, the cast, crew and attendees wore blue ribbons in honor of Reddick. “It’s not just one memory. It’s not just one day. It’s a collective. I had Lance in my life almost 10 years,” Stahelski told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. “Although that was done over the course of four films, we’ve worked together on other things. I just got to be happy and be proud of the fact that I got to spend so much time with him. We’re going to miss him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lance-reddick-.jpg><p>“I just want to say something about a great man and a great artist, a good friend, that was part of our family. Lance Reddick passed away today,” Stahelski told the crowd at the film’s premiere in Toronto, Canada, choking up briefly as Anderson put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him. “So you guys get to meet him up on the screen. He’s a great part of the family and hopefully you enjoy the performance.” Co-star Ian McShane also released a statement to Variety,&nbsp;“Total shock and disbelief. Lance was a wonderful human being and a wonderful colleague. My deepest condolences, peace and love to his wife, Stephanie, and all&nbsp;his family.”</p><p>In one of his last interviews with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> E! News,</a> Reddick was surprised with the ferocity of the franchise. “I couldn’t believe that it was bigger than the last one,” Lance told the outlet on March 3, 2023. “I don’t know how you can have more action and better action, but we do. Also, the emotional stakes have been raised I feel for the characters more than any other franchise.” He continued,&nbsp;“I think some fans will be like, ‘Wow. I wanna do that again. Other fans will be like, ‘Okay, I need a martini. That was a lot.'”</p><p>The Wire&nbsp;creator David Simon said in a statement that Reddick was a” consummate professional, a devoted collaborator, a lovely soul and a friend. This is just gutting and way, way, way too soon for any of us who knew and loved him to contemplate.”</p><p>Fellow The Wire actor Wendell Pierce <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted</a> in honor of his friend, “A man of great strength and grace. As talented a musician as he was an actor. The epitome of class. An sudden unexpected sharp painful grief for our artistic family. An unimaginable suffering for his personal family and loved ones. Godspeed my friend. You made your mark here. RIP.”</p><p>Rick Riordan, the author of the Percy Jackson series, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">mourned the loss</a> of Reddick who plays Zeus in the Season 1 adaptation of the famed book series. “We are devastated to hear of the untimely passing of Lance Reddick, our Zeus in season one of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I’ve been in shock since yesterday, trying to understand how such a vibrant, kind and talented man could be so quickly taken from the world.” He continued, “It will be difficult working on those scenes in which Lance appears — not just because we mourn him, but because they will remind us of how much brilliance we have lost. At least it’s comforting to know that we’ll be able to share that performance with Lance’s millions of fans, and we will get to see his artistry in action one more time. As for me, I have trouble believing such a force of nature could ever really be gone. I will choose to think that maybe Mount Olympus simply had need of their king. Godspeed, Mr. Reddick, and thank you.”</p><p><i><span>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
