A Roman fertility festival was the holiday's precursor.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">It may be difficult to believe given how innocuous the holiday is nowadays, but the roots of Valentine's Day stem from a bloody pagan fertility festival dating back to 6th century B.C. Every year, between February 13 and 15, Romans celebrated Lupercalia by sacrificing animals and slapping women with their hides, which was believed to make them more fertile. Later, notes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Valentines-Day data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Britannica.com class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Britannica.com</a>, the women would be paired off with men "by lottery." Definitely not the most romantic way to find an S.O.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">2. There was more than one St. Valentine.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">History tells us that Pope Gelasius I outlawed Lupercalia at the end of the 5th century and instituted St. Valentine's Day on February 14. But who was the holiday's patron saint?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Most sources point to one of two men of the same name: a third-century Roman priest who defied (and was martyred by) Claudius II Gothicus, or another priest of the same time period but who hailed from a town about 60 miles away in what is modern-day Terni, Italy (he was also martyred by Claudius II).

Valentine's Day wasn't romantic until the Middle Ages.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">And we have birds and Chaucer to thank. In medieval times, it was common wisdom that birds began mating in mid-February, specifically on the 14th, aka St. Valentine's Day. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://folklore-society.com/resources/valentines/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Folklore Society" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">The Folklore Society</a>, people in those days tended to refer to dates by the saint designated on that day by the Church's calendar (there were no printed calendars and names were easier to remember than numbers). Through this happenstance, Valentine's Day became associated with making like a bird and pairing off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">This notion is the theme of one of the earliest Valentine's Day poems associating the day with romantic love and marriage, “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/Fowls.php data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Parliament of Fowls" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Parliament of Fowls</a>,” penned by Chaucer in 1381: "For this was on Saint Valentine’s day, / When every fowl comes there his mate to take," goes one of the verses. The late scholar <a href=# data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://obituaries.ljworld.com/obituaries/ljworld/obituary.aspx?pid=169665717" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack B. Oruch" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Jack B. Oruch</a>, a University of Kansas English professor, determined that Chaucer was the first to link St. Valentine's Day and romance, which, Oruch theorized, made the poet the originator of the romantic holiday we celebrate today. Regardless of whether Chaucer can take full credit, he certainly popularized the idea.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">4. The earliest known valentine has a sad love story behind it.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The very first valentine is said to have been a poem sent in 1415 by Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his wife.

Was the phrase a stroke of poetic genius, or did the famous bard draw it from real life?

It's believed that this symbol represented Christ on the cross, which in turn meant faith and fidelity. As a show of devotion, people would then kiss the X, and thus, over the centuries, X evolved into a smooch. It's not known how O came to signify a hug, but some suppose it was simply because, like X, it was also easy to write.</p><img alt="boston terrier dog with red heart shaped sucker in his mouth" title="boston terrier dog with red heart shaped sucker in his mouth" width=2835 height=2835 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/valentines-day-facts-dog-1642543914.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">RETALES BOTIJERO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=57 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">16.
