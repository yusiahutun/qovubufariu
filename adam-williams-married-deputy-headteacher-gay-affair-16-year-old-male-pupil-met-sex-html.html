At the beginning Mr Williams didn’t know who the person was that he was communicating with.</span></p><p><span>'Through the course of these communications Mr Williams expressed clearly how keen he was to meet up for sexual purposes.</span></p><p><span>'(Initially) the schoolboy was saying he was someone called James Rule, who was 20 and worked in retail.</span></p><p><span>'But by June 15, 2011, and although Mr Williams had suspected it might be him that he was in contact with, he (the teen) confirmed he was the pupil.'</span></p><p><span>The youth was a student at the school where Williams worked and taking his GCSE examinations that summer. Nothing happened between them over the summer term or over the summer holidays, the jury of seven women and five men was told.</span></p><p><span>The pupil was planning to leave the Oxfordshire school after completing his GCSEs and was set for an apprenticeship at Thomson Holidays in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said Mr May.</span></p><p><span>However, during the course of the summer holiday he decided he wanted to remain at the school and join the Sixth Form to take his A-levels after the apprenticeship fell through.</span></p><p><span>The dark-haired defendant, who appeared in court d</span><span>ressed in a smart dark suit and tie, </span><span>had the role of deciding whether the pupil could rejoin the school in the Sixth Form.</span></p><p><span>'Text message exchanges continued during that period,' Mr May told the jury. 'It’s quite clear that Mr Williams knew who it was he was in contact with.</span></p><p><span>'In due course they did meet up and had a number of incidents of a sexual nature.'</span></p><p><span>The barrister said it was a criminal offence for teachers to engage in sexual activity with somebody under 18 who is a pupil at the school where they work.</span></p><p><span>There was a total of 6,461 exchanged text messages and 1,430 through Ping, a chatroom website, between May and December last year.</span></p><p><span>'There were seven meetings between the two where sexual activity took place.' Sometimes it was kissing, and other times they engaged in sexual acts, prosecutor said.</span></p><p><span>On one occasion the pair were in the attic above the common room for which Williams had a key, the court heard. The teacher was allegedly performing a sex act on the boy when they were interrupted.</span></p><p><span>'Footsteps were heard on the spiral staircase and it was the cleaner,' said the prosecutor. 'He (the youth) was told to hide under a table.'</span></p><p><span>Later the pair were said to have exchanged messages referring to the near miss. The teacher texted: 'I’m shi**ing it. He’s gone. I can’t believe it.'</span></p><p><span>The youth sought to calm the panicked teacher by saying: 'For every hour that passes we know we are in the clear.'</span></p><p><span>Williams also texted the schoolboy after the near miss, saying: 'Shame I didn’t get to finish what I started.'</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/18/article-2205148-151483CB000005DC-522_634x403.jpg height=403 width=634 alt="21st century dating: The website of smartphone app Grindr, through which Williams and the boy are said to have met" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>21st century dating: The website of smartphone app Grindr, through which Williams and the boy are said to have met</p><p><span>The alleged victim, now 17, told police he did not feel like a victim and claimed he had 'betrayed' his teacher by telling detectives what happened.</span></p><p><span>'First of all I felt a bit nervous about the experience then afterwards I felt disgusted,' he said during an interview with officers.

I was the one who agreed to it.'</span></p><p><span>The youth appeared in the witness box and looked through the messages allegedly exchanged with Williams over an eight-month period last year. Mr May read some aloud.</span></p><p><span>'I don’t think you realise how much I want you,' the teacher wrote.</span></p><p><span>The teacher also wrote: 'I’ve never been in this situation. I don’t know what to say.'</span></p><p><span>The pupil replied with the message: 'I think it was bound to happen.'</span></p><p><span>Williams said he could be sacked and was worried about his job if word about the relationship got out. 'Yes I’ve kissed a student, it’s a sackable offence,' said Williams.</span></p><p><span>Mr May told the court how the affair was only exposed when the pupil's sister looked through his mobile phone and found both text messages and images on the phone which were sexual.</span></p><p><span>'They talked about meeting up in rooms at school. She asked her brother about the messages and somewhat reluctantly he said it was Mr Williams,' the barrister said.</span></p><p><span>'She saw explicit images of Mr Williams including his bottom, penis, in the office she knew to be the Sixth Form office, in the shower, and on the bed on all fours naked.'</span></p><p><span>Williams denies seven charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child in a position of trust and one count of encouraging or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity in a position of trust.</span></p><p><span>Williams was expected to argue that he was being blackmailed by the boy about the sexual relationship after the swapping of compromising pictures, Mr May told the jury.</span></p><p><span>The case was adjourned until tomorrow when Edmund Vickers, defending Williams, will cross-examine the alleged victim.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fc3yUamtxZ3GZrq55tqKjpaGRosBumcCrqaKdlGKxprzUrbBmoJWWsbWxwJyfnqpdnK66ecCfnZqhomJ%2Bd3nYnpirZZ%2BhsW65wKWcZqilpbatecyeq2arla17qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
