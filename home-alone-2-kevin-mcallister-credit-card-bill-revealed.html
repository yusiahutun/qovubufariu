But for kids, it turned Manhattan into a wonderland, full of opportunities for adventure.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9fcD-RDaJqy data-wc=12><strong>WATCH: Catch Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&nbsp;on Disney Plus</strong></p><p id=ei3qZuMHf5FN data-wc=14>The bill, though, is enough to make anyone's eyes water –&nbsp;especially in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6_B1Kr7JzBC data-wc=33>As the movie celebrates its 30th anniversary this year (we know, we can't quite believe it either), we calculated exactly how much Kevin's three-day excursion around the city would actually cost to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7_vSCS1XEHG data-wc=10>We hope American Express is ready for quite the bashing.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Cab Ride from JFK to the Plaza Hotel - $78, plus $15.60 tip (£76.84)</h2><p id=eR5ErQcS072I data-wc=37>After accidentally getting on the wrong flight in Chicago, Kevin finds himself not in Florida as planned, but in New York City –&nbsp;with just a wad of his dad's cash and a credit card for company.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8UW9Zpuj96p data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 films that are a must-watch this week in December</a></strong></p><p id=eYcAA30vOGte data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>9 Christmas movies that are coming out in 2022</a></strong></p><p id=efyQRe3Z43En data-wc=20>Let the adventures begin. Soon he's leaning out the window of a cab as he makes his way into Manhattan.&nbsp;</p><p id=euRaCH3YgAr2 data-wc=38>Nowadays, an Uber from JFK to the Plaza costs $78, not including tip (which in NY is a standard 20%). Kevin iconically tipped everyone in chewing gum, but we have a feeling this won't fly in today's climate.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Two night stay at the Plaza Hotel - $4665 (£3827.17)</h2><p id=eK7balYhiq1e data-wc=44>"I'd like a hotel room please, with an extra large bed, a TV, and one of those little refrigerators you have to open with a key" is the demand Kevin makes when he fakes being his dad to secure a room at the Plaza.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/30815e2a6142-tilly-limo-ride-with-pizza-z.jpg><p id=ebnweWPPtM4Q data-wc=11><strong>A cab ride from JFK to the Plaza Hotel cost $78</strong></p><p id=eElbhfuMHiu9 data-wc=45>What he ends up with is suite 411 –&nbsp;one of the most luxurious rooms in the entire hotel. Unfortunately, it's on the residents side of the building, so officially (unless you're about to rent up there long term), you can't stay in the room.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKHLC3D33wZw data-wc=32>Thankfully, pretty much every room at the hotel now has this as standard (as well as a luxury bathtub and shower you can do the Cool Jerk in, if you so desire.)&nbsp;</p><p id=eCQ89hYaev8L data-wc=35>Prices start at $1495 per night for what Kevin requires, so the minimum you're looking at here is $4485, a $60 per night "urban tax" fee. So the minimum you're looking at is $4665 (£3829.87)</p><p id=evGAIf42O8dG data-wc=29>According to the Plaza's website, prices for the most expensive room come in at an eye-watering $75000 a night. (No, we did not get that number of zeroes wrong).&nbsp;</p><p id=eA_nm6rDf7Dc data-wc=20>Access to the gym and pool comes as standard, though, so you can practice your cannonballs to your heart's content.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Ice Cream Mountain Room Service - $196.76 (£161.54)</h2><p id=eEo1qFiyHVW2 data-wc=9>Two scoops? Make it three –&nbsp;you're not driving!&nbsp;</p><p id=e0EJaLcsgNBg data-wc=24>Your standard Plaza ice-cream sundae delivered to the room is $23, and comes with three scoops, whipped cream, maraschino cherries, M&M’s and chocolate sauce.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0729cd112eb1-ice-cream-mountain-z.jpg><p id=emrr9PlDfJBP data-wc=6><strong>Ice cream room service cost&nbsp;$196.76</strong></p><p id=eULAQXlbxK3b data-wc=32>But Kevin didn't settle for anything standard, and while this is just an estimation, the absolutely giant serving platter he has delivered to his room must be at the least 21 scoops.&nbsp;</p><p id=esUoOXTiX_Nj data-wc=16>So that comes to $161, not including delivery fee ($10), service charge (16%) and a tip.&nbsp;</p><p id=eym2DTyYWamI data-wc=5>Total cost? At least $196.76.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehvE-SiSEKDO data-wc=13>We hope for your sake your eyes are as big as your stomach.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Limo Ride With An Extra Large Cheese Pizza and Coke - $715 (£587)</h2><p id=eDL2JRhGVklY data-wc=46>We have to hand it to Kevin for pulling a wangle on this one – after the Concierge breaks into his room to try and catch him out, he uses a blow up doll to make him believe that his dad was actually there with him.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLuUwqaTbJan data-wc=39>His trickery worked so well that, out of embarrassment for "catching Kevin's dad in the shower", the Concierge hands the pizza and limo to him "courtesy of the Plaza" –&nbsp;meaning that dream trip in style was absolutely free.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7xuA-Z4REO7 data-wc=34>Unfortunately, if you were to have this moment yourself, you're either going to have to orchestrate a situation where a disgruntled employee catches you in the shower (not recommended) or foot the bill yourself.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekD5LASz0Nya data-wc=31>According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>NYC United Limos</a>, it costs $680 for four hours of driving around, while the Pizza and Coca-Cola will likely set you back around $25 depending on where you get it from.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejgdxaTGLFob data-wc=17>So while Kevin got it without charge, you'll be looking at around $715 to recreate this moment.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Trip to Duncan's Toy Chest - $92.93 (£76.29)</h2><p id=eb_LvBbPyIdx data-wc=29>Unfortunately, a trip to Duncan's Toy Chest is impossible as sadly... it doesn't exist. But the store is based on FAO Schwartz, which has a location in Rockerfeller Plaza.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRDkj1OPpnKK data-wc=35>It's about a 15-minute walk, but hey... if you have a limo at your disposal, why wouldn't you take a look and get some treats if you're a kid with a seemingly endless credit limit?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e025645795ec-home-alone-toy-store-z.jpg><p id=eQEXboNhCE8x data-wc=6><strong>Duncan's Toy Chest sadly doesn't exist</strong></p><p id=etO8gbRF0lAa data-wc=19>Kevin's actually quite restrained here, considering – and only spends $23.75, plus a $20 donation to the children's charity.</p><p id=eqiJlpLB4LgY data-wc=19>Allowing for inflation, that's $92.93 in today's economy. But honestly, you can go as wild as you want here.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSP5JwuHHPA0 data-wc=22>(The toy store is also home to the Big floor piano, if you want to tick another childhood dream off your list.)&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Central Park –&nbsp;Free&nbsp;</h2><p id=eF_-vZLRFi70 data-wc=24>Finally a little excursion that won't break the bank! Central Park is just across the road from the Plaza, and costs precisely zero dollars.&nbsp;</p><p id=es8671ZPzJae data-wc=38>The major locations from Home Alone 2 aren't too much of a walk, either. You can get to Gapstow Bridge in five minutes, and Inscope Arch, where the Sticky Bandits are finally caught, is directly next to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewmPLfh8dHa8 data-wc=8>A Pigeon Lady is unfortunately not a guarantee.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4923227158d-home-alone-central-park-z.jpg><p id=eEUy3OiLn59a data-wc=7><strong>A trip to Central Park is free</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Rockefeller Plaza Christmas Tree –&nbsp;Free</h2><p id=e0n24ndsYqpJ data-wc=49>Kevin does get a little thrifty towards the end of his trip, and after stopping the Sticky Bandits in their tracks once again (causing an unknown amount of damage to a home on the Upper West Side in the process), he heads there to wish for his mum back.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_OGkA0kiXPP data-wc=17>Thankfully, he gets his Christmas wish, and she finds him there for a tearjerking and heartwarming reunion.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6Jdq_gC81wH data-wc=46>The Rockefeller Christmas Tree is lit up in the first days of December, and lasts throughout the Christmas season. It's usually pretty busy, unless you go there in the dead of night, but it's pretty all the same. Have someone to hug when you get there.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Room Service Bill: $1858.17 (£1525.52)&nbsp;</h2><p id=erJOA7x2NTFP data-wc=34>At the end of Home Alone 2, just when Kevin thinks he got away with it, his parents get the shocker of a lifetime when they're presented with his room service bill, totalling $967.43.&nbsp;</p><p id=efMDP-kzcrur data-wc=12>That's equivalent to $2054.93 today – no wonder his dad went screaming.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1G1ro3AswMh data-wc=27>Now, we've already factored in the $196.76 ice cream bill, so let's be nice and cut that off this total, but you're still looking at $1858.17. Yowch.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5508c2054dd1-home-alone-radio-city-z.jpg><p id=eTY7nrz0_rjT data-wc=6><strong>The total bill came to&nbsp;$7621.46</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Total Cost: $7621.46 (£6252.65)</h2><p id=erD7VpPjuy3W data-wc=44>For a whirlwind 48 hours, Kevin is going to have to do a lot of household chores in order to pay his parents back for the mammoth cost he racked up (and that's not even counting the fact we went for a cheaper room!).</p><p id=eE8YJuV4yc2A data-wc=32>Alas, looks like we might have to trade in the Plaza for now for a night on the couch with a bowl of Ben and Jerrys and a Home Alone 2 rewatch.&nbsp;</p><p id=ellK8LgENNoz data-wc=5>Merry Christmas, you filthy animals.&nbsp;</p><p id=eW1-OWWi_y_c data-wc=13><strong>Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is available now on Disney Plus.</strong></p><p id=ebcCWch5hCUF data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tqYWd9eH2UcmdubF%2BdvK6xjJqjqKaVYn9ut8SvoKdlnZiurbjIrKueql2Yv6awyK1knJmimXqjtculZKudppqurbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
