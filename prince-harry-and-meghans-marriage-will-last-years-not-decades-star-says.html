He poses a problem the Montecito couple face in the future.</strong></p><p>Graydon Carter, ex Vanity Fair editor, has claimed he doesn’t see <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan’s marriage lasting a lifetime. Despite their love story being ripped out of a fairy tale, he thinks <a href=#>Meghan Markl</a>e and Harry will suffer the outcome of half of all marriages. He also placed a bet on whether the Duchess of Sussex will return to the small screen after she gave it up to be <a href=#>Harry’s blushing bride</a> in 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-s-marriage-won-t-last-forever-editor-claims>Prince Harry and Meghan’s marriage ‘won’t last forever’, editor claims</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1684440815-772x1024.jpg><p>The 74-year-old told The Sunday Times his thoughts on the <a href=#>royals</a>‘ future.</p><p>He said: “I would measure the duration of the marriage in years rather than decades.</p><p>“I think she has run rings around poor Harry and gotten what she wanted: notoriety, money, and a title. His usefulness to her diminishes daily.”</p><p>Taking a leaf out of producer Andy Cohen’s book, Carter also thinks Meghan won’t return to <a href=#>TV</a>. She had appeared in <a href=#>Suits for several years</a>, but didn’t feature in the final season. However, the palace reportedly had <a href=#>strict rules on what would happen in her final scenes,</a> though.</p><p>He thinks the 42-year-old is more suited to the <a href=#>celebrity</a> lifestyle Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise offers.</p><p>He added: “If there is a&nbsp;‘Real Housewives of Montecito’&nbsp;show in the works, she’d be a shoo-in.”</p><p>Carter worked as Vanity Fair’s editor between 1992 and 2017, so missed most of the action of the Sussexes, who tied the knot in 2018.</p><p><strong>GRV Media has reached out to Meghan and Harry’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royals-spark-split-fears-after-meghan-s-engagement-ring-was-missing>Royals spark split fears after Meghan’s engagement ring was missing</h2><p>It comes a couple of months after <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s missing engagement ring</a> on her finger sparked speculations their relationship was on the rocks.</p><p>The Duchess was seen only wearing a gold band instead of her special engagement ring in August. In the picture, the mom-of-two was hanging out with friends at the time. The sparkling piece of jewelry is extra sentimental as it features two special stones from <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s collection. It also has a diamond, from Botswana, which is where the couple has fond memories from their early blossoming courtship.</p><p>After Harry popped the question, Meghan praised his work on designing the ring.</p><p>She said: “Everything about Harry’s thoughtfulness and the inclusion of [Princess Diana’s stones] and obviously not being able to meet his mom, it’s so important to me to know that she’s a part of this with us.”</p><p>However, despite fears it meant there were facing problems, the <a href=#>real reason Meghan’s ring was missing</a> was quite boring.</p><p>The couple were then seen together at the Invictus Games, an event in New York, a holiday in the Caribbean and Katy Perry’s final concert in Las Vegas.</p><p>We’re sure they’re more than enjoying their happily ever after.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WFcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnqmalkae%2Fqq3GnmSwoZyheq2t0q1ksp2Rp8Buus6tZJ2dk5axpr%2BMrKuaql2orrq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
