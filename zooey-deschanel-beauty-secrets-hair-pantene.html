So when <a href=# id=auto-tag_pantene data-tag=pantene>Pantene</a> announced her as their new spokesperson at a breakfast last week, I had to sit down with her and find out exactly what goes into her beauty prep. Always wanted her seemingly perfect waves and never-ending lashes? Here the New Girl star lets me in on seven of her biggest beauty secrets.</p><p><strong>1. She Went Blonde…And Hated It</strong><br>“I had to dye my hair blonde for a screen test years ago, and it really wasn’t me,” she said. She rocks her own natural color now: “I’m a brunette at heart. When I had blonde hair I would wake up and be like, shocked. Your hair is part of your identity, and I’ve always felt like a brunette with bangs.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Could You Do A Bang?</strong></a></p><p><strong>2. She Wants a Bob, Now.</strong><br>“If I could cut my hair today, I totally would. Oh my God, I love a Louise Brooks bob, I would rock that, for sure!” And her bangs? “I’ve always felt more comfortable with bangs. I grew them out a few years ago, but I missed them. My bangs definitely have their own personality.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2012/05/136079369-cropped-proto-custom_14.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/chloe-fineman.jpg><p><strong>3. She Hates The Feeling Of Hair Product</strong><br>“I don’t like to feel product in my hair, I really like the Pantene products because there’s tons to choose from, and they’re really light,” she said. “You can touch your hair and it doesn’t feel crispy or anything like that. Pantene Fine Hair Spray still has hold, which is ideal because I have a lot of hair but its strands are fine. If I have product that weighs it down, I’m going to end up with flat hair.”</p><p><strong>4. She Prefers Hot Rollers To a Curling Iron</strong><br>“Personally, I do a lot of different things. If I’m just going out, I’ll just dry it really fast and then let the rest dry naturally, because I have some wave. Then I’ll use a curling iron. That said, I prefer a set, like a roller set (which they use on the set of New Girl), or I’ll use a combination of rollers, like Velcro rollers on top and a hot roller on the bottom.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>How To Get Longer Lashes</strong></a></p><p><strong>5. Her Hair May Seem Perfect, But She Has A Cowlick</strong><br>“I have a natural cowlick that keeps my bangs in place, so it’s pretty easy to keep them neat. But I usually use a [round] brush and dry them at an angle just to be sure.”</p><img decoding=async alt=C2.jpg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2012/05/c2.jpg width=400 height=267 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span>Zooey Deschanel shows me that quirky can be just as hot as sexy</span><p><strong>6. Her Lashes Need Major Mascara</strong><br>“The weird thing about my lashes is that they’re blonde on the tips; they’re long but I need mascara for them even to show up.” Her mascara of choice? “I like the Rimmel Glam’Eyes Day-2-Night, because it’s easy to get all the gunk off the brush and build [your lashes] up.”</p><p><strong>7. She Needs Highlighter</strong><br>“I like a little highlighter in the corners of my eyes–it’s a trick I really think that opens everything up. Some people look great with eyeliner all around the eye, but not for me.” And that perfect cat eye? “I’ve mastered the cat’s eye [and liquid liner], because I’ve been doing it for years, since high school!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8doOWb2hsZ6qkvKbFjJ2crJuYlrumuIybnJqtpK56tLHCq5ytq12drqq%2BjKmYp6yVo7Jw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
