God is&nbsp;love. The devil is&nbsp;the tempter and&nbsp;he is continuously&nbsp;trying to “side-track” us with sin’s temptation, which&nbsp;can put a division&nbsp;in our relationship with God. He&nbsp;(Satan) desires to&nbsp;remove our focus/attention from our Heavenly Father and place it on our problems. In other words, he wants to sidetrack us. Many times when we are going through a tough time (storm), we can’t think about anything else except our problem. I have this mental picture&nbsp;of Satan tempting us with sin and then sitting back laughing at us if we yield to it.</p><p>“The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy …” John 10:10.</p><p>The devil is not a promise keeper. He’s not our friend. His purpose is to pull our attention away from God and utterly destroy us. Does he have power? Yes, he does BUT …</p><p>“You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one (Jesus) who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” 1 John 4:4.</p><p>Yes! God is telling us that we have His strength and power in us, which is greater than the devil and his sin. Friends, we, as Christians, are overcomers!</p><p>“Jesus said to him (devil), ‘Away from me, Satan! For it is written:</p><p>Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’ Then the devil left Him, and angels came and attended Him.” Matthew 4: 10-11.</p><p>There’s power in worship! Why? Because it puts our focus back on God and God alone and is expressed in love. When we worship, we don’t focus on our problems but instead on our Heavenly Father, the problem solver. So, the bot- tom line is: Focus on God and not the&nbsp;sin!</p><p>“The truth is that there&nbsp;is more grace, more of the POWER OF GOD, and more of the power of righteousness in you than there&nbsp;has ever been sin. If you believe in the power of God as much you believe in the power of sin, sin will never seem big at all. Goliath was big when compared with David. But David was smart enough to compare the giant with God. Why don’t you do the same&nbsp;with your sin?” Dr. James Richard.</p><p>Whatever trial you are facing today, understand that God’s grace is greater! We are His children! Rejoice, Jesus paid the price on the cross so we could be overcomers!</p><p>It all begins with love (worship) and a thankful heart. Remember, “The JOY of the Lord is our STRENGTH.” Nehemiah 8:10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKegnruqu81omqikpaK7qr%2FTrGagp5RiwG6z0ZqanmWXp7KiwMSrZK2gkaN6urvUq2Spqp%2BXuaa50miYq6yZmLmmq5FwnJuaY5uGboOYnJlmbZVpfm6twW%2BdZm1im4SirpdtcHFtYWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
