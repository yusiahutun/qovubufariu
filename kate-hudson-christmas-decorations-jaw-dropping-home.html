I love the holidays so much and throughout the years have collected trees, Santa’s, music boxes, snow villages, ornaments, and more. We bake, cook, sing, share laughs, and create light to shine everywhere, we wish for love and peace.&nbsp;</p><p id=enXwXTfawZS data-wc=74>"I am a lover of this time over year and soak every minute of it up," she continued. "I guess that is a good metaphor for how I feel about life and celebrating our time here. It’s as fleeting as the holidays. Here today, gone tomorrow. So I choose to make it sweet and cozy. Everyday. And of course every Holiday. Wishing sweet and cozy to everyone. PS. More decorations and cozy to come."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=312f569b9374-kate-hudson-christmas-decor>Her back room</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/312f569b9374-kate-hudson-christmas-decor.jpg><p dir=ltr>Kate's back room has incredible French doors looking out onto the pool - a haven in the summertime.
