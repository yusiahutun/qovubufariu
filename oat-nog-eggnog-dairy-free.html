The sweet and creamy beverage, which can be enjoyed with or without alcohol, typically has a base of eggs, milk, and heavy cream; so it’s not exactly easy to enjoy if you’re dairy-free.&nbsp;But there’s a solution for the lactose-challenged: oat nog!</p><p>In recent years, <a href=#>milk alternatives</a> like oat milk, soy milk, and nut milk have become increasingly popular, as many people struggle with lactose intolerance. There’s also a growing interest in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">health benefits of giving up dairy</a>. These benefits can include weight loss, an improvement in gut health, and a decrease in inflammation. So, if you’re cutting back on dairy or following a vegan diet, but still crave eggnog this holiday season, consider trying oat nog — it (arguably) tastes just as good as the original. Read on to discover how to make it.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is oat nog?</h2><p>As its name suggests, oat nog is simply eggnog made with oat milk; and with this non-dairy option being so ubiquitous these days (you can even get it in the seasonal drinks at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbucks</a>), plenty of brands are taking advantage. The Kentucky-based spirits brand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Misunderstood Whiskey Co</a>. recently released a drink they’re calling “America’s first Hard Oat Nog.” I tried it — and honestly, it tasted quite similar to traditional eggnog. Even without any dairy, it maintained enough decadent, milkshakey flavor and consistency that I wanted to sip it curled up on the couch in front of a fireplace while watching Christmas movies.</p><p>Misunderstood Whiskey Co.’s hard oat nog bottle comes ready-to-drink, and contains 14 percent alcohol by volume in the form of ginger-spiced whiskey. I personally prefer the warming flavor of whiskey over the sweetness of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rum or brandy</a>, which are often used in eggnogs; plus, the nuttiness of the oat milk adds a nice flavor that reminded me of almond cookies. While eggnog is beloved for its richness, it can also be a little too rich for some — so the fact that this particular take on eggnog is free of artificial sweeteners and allergens makes it even more light and wholesome.</p><p>With so many people embracing a dairy-free lifestyle, it’s no surprise that Misunderstood Whiskey Co.’s hard oat nog is out of stock online as I write this — though it is available at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">select liquor stores</a> around the country. You can also try one of the non-alcoholic oat nogs on the market — from brands like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chobani</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elmhurst</a> — and spike them with a spirit of your choice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can I make oat nog at home?</h2><p>Like classic eggnog, oat nog is very easy to make, and there are many ways to change it up to suit your taste, like adding different spices or booze. Here’s a basic recipe for oat nog, adapted from the oat milk brand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Planet Oat</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredients (Serves 4):</strong></p><ul><li>4 cups oat milk</li><li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>4 ounces bourbon</li><li>4 cinnamon sticks</li></ul><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><li>Add first four ingredients to medium saucepan and bring to low simmer.&nbsp;Simmer 10 minutes to allow flavors to infuse, stirring frequently.&nbsp;</li><li>Remove from heat and let cool. Pour cooled eggnog into pitcher, stir in bourbon, cover, and refrigerate for at least two hours, or until ready to serve.</li><li>When ready to serve, stir vigorously, then pour into four glasses. Sprinkle with nutmeg or grate nutmeg over top. Garnish with cinnamon stick.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What other oat milk drinks should I try?</h2><p>Maybe you’re not interested in eggnog or oat nog. That’s okay — there are still plenty of oat milk drinks for you to choose from this season. Enjoy the last vestiges of fall with an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Crisp Oat Milk Macchiato</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oat Milk Pumpkin Spice Latte</a>, make an oat milk-based <a href=#>Brown Sugar Black Tea Latte</a>, or drop some marshmallows into an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oat Milk Hot Chocolate</a>.</p><p>If a drink recipe requires regular milk, you can always swap it out for oat milk. So, whether you’re drinking pre-packaged oat nog, making your own, or having another oat milk drink entirely this year, we wish you a delicious and dairy-free holiday season!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJom6uhnqDAcLvArWSnp5disqizzaieZpyRnr%2B6ecWrnJ4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
