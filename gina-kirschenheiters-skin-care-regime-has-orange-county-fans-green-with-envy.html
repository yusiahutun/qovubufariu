The RHOC star is now oozing confidence having turned her face into a smooth sensation…</strong></p><p>She promoted her new skincare brand Caragala on The Real Housewives of Orange County latest episode, which left Bravo fans scouring the Internet for reviews on the company products.</p><p>The reality TV star claims to have used her products for almost two years,&nbsp;which has transformed her face into visibly softer, brighter, and clearer skin with “less breakouts”. Fans everywhere are uber jealous.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV8436The Real Housewives of the New York City | Official Trailer | Amazon Primehttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/QbNfRMDb3mk/hqdefault.jpg955407955407center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gina-s-skin-transformation>Gina’s skin transformation</h2><p>Gina went from having blotchy, red patches on her face to clear, glowy skin. This is the effect of almost two years using Caragala, the RHOC star’s new branded products. She claimed she saw a “dramatic difference” in three months.</p><p>Her top favorites are Combination Skin Regimen and the Rapid Therapy Masque. It was in January 2022 that Gina began sharing her skin transformation publicly, despite admitting she felt embarrassed about how it looked before.</p><p>She told fans that she “hasn’t always had glowing skin” and wrote:</p><p>I started&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>@caragalaskincare</a>&nbsp;because I have completely transformed my appearance for the better and want that for you too!! The struggle was real.</p><p>Considering Gina has been using her products for around two years, yet only launched the company very recently, it appears to have been years in the making to create her own brand.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">A post shared by Gina Kirschenheiter (@ginakirschenheiter)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-buy-from-rhoc-star-s-brand>Buy from RHOC star’s brand</h2><p>If you fancy transforming your skin to Gina’s similar smoothness, you can head to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Caragala website</a>, where there are three regimen bundles available to purchase. They each cost $160.</p><p>The bundles are for three different skin types, including dry skin, combination skin and blemish prone skin regimen. However, you can also buy each product on their own, such as the ‘100% Hyaluronic Serum’ for $48.</p><p>Created to inspire women to radiate confidence, the website states Gina “was fed up with being uncomfortable and self-conscious after my skin was impacted by my move from New York to California and life’s stress the past few years.”</p><p>You can also get 15 percent off by signing up to the company’s email subscription, while free shipping is available if you spend over $50 on the website.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes gina!! She’s got this hw thing figured out she started an actual skin care line Whitney take notes! <a href=#>#RHOC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/38oHPvK9vf</a></p>— The Reality TV Guru (@Realitytvguru13) <a href=#>December 22, 2021</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-exploring-caragala-reviews>Exploring Caragala reviews</h2><p>With the company being so new, Caragala only has two reviews on its Facebook page so far. It has a five-star rating on the social media platform, which includes one user saying they are “thrilled with the product line”.</p><p>One review <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “WOW Gina! I have used the mask only a couple of times, but I am so impressed! I have rosacea and occasional acne. This mask worked wonders! My acne was already diminished and my face was less red after one use.“</p><p>However, someone on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Reddit</a> who claims to research skincare ingredients for a living said that they don’t feel the skincare is worth $160, and urged fans to “skip Caragala”.</p><p>The company website is filled with positive reviews, with a user claiming the ‘Blemish Prone Skin Regimen’ gives their face the “deep cleanse it needs” while another said the Dry Skin Regimen is “amazing”.</p><p>Overall though, viewers cannot believe Gina’s skin transformation, with 4.8K likes on her before and after video. Many have described her skin as “flawless” and “beautiful-looking”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good luck Gina with your skin care line.
