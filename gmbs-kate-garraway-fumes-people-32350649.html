' and I knew that would happen because people don't understand and they probably haven't been through that situation maybe that Derek has experienced and millions of others do.", reports <a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>the Mirror</a>.</p><p>Kate Garraway shared her feelings, saying: "I hope that people understand why. It is important not to just walk away from something just because the person for whom made it very relevant to our family life isn't there. It wouldn't be right for Derek. I hope people understand and I hope they find it helpful. There are moments of joy in there too as there always were along the way. Hopefully it'll be good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32263146.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_GMBs-Ben-Shephards-replacement-confirmed-as-fan-favourite-announces-return.jpg><p>Ed Balls mentioned that viewers might be upset to hear Kate was getting trolled. She answered: "I get a huge amount of love so it's fine to get a little bit of hate along the way as well because people can express their opinions. I just knew some people would say that but for the millions of people it would help, and Derek and the children, it felt the best thing to do."</p><p>Later, Kate said that Derek had wanted a third episode of their documentary because he "wanted to be heard".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Derek expressed his desire to be part of the film, saying: "I want to be heard,". Kate also shared her thoughts: "Obviously when we started making this documentary early last year, we had no idea the events that would unfold that ultimately took Derek from us.</p><p>"And in January 2024, I wondered if it was right that it should ever come to air. But I didn't want to let those who have given us so much support over the last four years down, and the carers paid and unpaid who in their thousands of letters to me, feel Derek's story has given them a voice. Also, I remembered so vividly that the idea of making this third documentary at all came from Derek himself."</p><p><b>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter.</a>'</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLSurtJmopqslWK0or7Rmq6asV2bwq6x0mannqegobJuf5FsbGluZG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
