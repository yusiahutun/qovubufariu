Keyboard Shortcut to Hide Files</h2><p>Keyboard shortcuts make everything on Mac easier. It is the fastest way to hide files on your Mac. Select the file you wish to hide and simultaneously press the <strong>Command + Shift + Period (.)</strong> keys. This method is great because you must repeat the same keyboard shortcut to reveal the files.</p><p>This keyboard shortcut only works in macOS Ventura or later. You can check that your Mac is updated in <strong>System Settings</strong> > <strong>General</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong>.</p><p>The drawback of this method is that it doesn't require any security verification. That means this shortcut lets anyone accessing your Mac view all your hidden files in unlocked folders. Also, you can't use this method to hide multiple files at a time; you must repeat the keyboard command on each file and folder you wish to hide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=use-filevault-to-create-invisible-folders>2. Use FileVault to Create Invisible Folders</h2><p>FileVault is one of <a href=#>Mac's built-in security features</a> that encode files on your Mac with a password. It is an effective way to hide files on your Mac because no one can access the hidden files without the password or credentials of your Mac. In older Macs, FileVault encryption can affect the speed of your Mac, but you can reduce this possibility by updating macOS before using FileVault.</p><p>Here are the steps to use FileVault:</p><li>Open <strong>System Settings</strong> from the <strong>Apple menu</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Privacy & Security</strong> on the left and scroll down to <strong>FileVault</strong>.</li><li>Click turn on and input your password.</li><li>Choose your recovery method and select continue.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/filevault-recovery-options-in-system-settings.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you select <strong>Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk</strong>, the encrypting process begins automatically. With <strong>Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account</strong>, the system generates a recovery key. You must save this recovery key because you can't access all the files on your disk without your recovery key and password.</p><p>If your Mac has additional user accounts, their information is also encrypted. The downside is that each user can unlock the encrypted disk with their login password.</p><h2 id=use-terminal-to-hide-folders>3. Use Terminal to Hide Folders</h2><p>Terminal is the built-in command-line utility on your Mac that can keep your files hidden and protected. It's a default Mac application, allowing you to use <a href=#>special Terminal commands to perform operations</a>.</p><p>Here is how to use Terminal to hide files on your Mac:</p><li>Launch the Terminal from Launchpad or using Spotlight search (<strong>Command</strong> + <strong>Space bar</strong>).</li><li>Type in the following command:<pre>chflags hidden</pre></li><li>Leave a space, then drag and drop the file or folder you want to hide.</li><li>Hit Return, and the file disappears.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/terminal-command-to-hide-file-showing-the-folder-path.jpg><p>The Terminal command to hide a file is immediate, but sometimes, it may not work as so. You need to relaunch Finder to make the file disappear when this happens.</p><p>Hold the <strong>Option</strong> key and <strong>Control</strong>-click the <strong>Finder </strong>icon to relaunch Finder, then the file immediately disappears.</p><p>To view and reveal files in Terminal:</p><li>Launch <strong>Terminal</strong> from Spotlight and enter this command:<pre>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true; killall Finder</pre></li><li>Hit <strong>Return</strong> and the icons of the hidden files reappear, although they appear faded.

Make Files Invisible With a Dot</h2><p>Another simple way to hide files on your Mac is by adding a period or dot before the file name. A common attribute of hidden Mac files is that they all start with a period, so if you save your file name with a dot, the system automatically treats it as a hidden file.</p><p>So, follow these steps to make your files invisible:</p><li>Select the file you need to hide and <strong>Control</strong>-click on it.</li><li>Add a dot in front of it and tap <strong>Return</strong>.</li><li>Confirm in the following prompt that you want the system to see that file as invisible, and your file becomes translucent.</li><li>You can then use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Command</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Period (.)</strong>, and the files disappear in Finder.</li><li>Repeat this keyboard shortcut to make your files visible in Finder. Then, rename it to remove the dot before the file name, and you will have your file back as usual.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/folder-with-a-dot-and-invincible-file-confirmation-prompt.jpg><h2 id=hide-files-with-a-user-account>5. Hide Files With a User Account</h2><p>This isn't like the other methods where your files disappear. Instead, you can keep your files discreet by creating different user accounts on your Mac.

Good examples of these apps include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleanshot X</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Parallels Toolbox</a>.</p><h2 id=keep-your-files-safe-by-hiding-them>Keep Your Files Safe by Hiding Them</h2><p>Hiding files on your Mac is a smart way to keep your data secure.
