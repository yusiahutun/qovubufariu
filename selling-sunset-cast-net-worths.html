Before starring on the Netflix show, 41-year-old Chrishell starred in US soaps, Days of Our Lives,&nbsp;and All My Children, which perhaps explains her incredible wealth.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=eBFzqtsVfuxv data-wc=62>It's believed the stars of Selling Sunset don't actually have a salary for appearing on the show, however the commission they earn for their work which is featured alongside the extra publicity their careers gain is significant. This explains how the brunette beauty secured her own $3 million home which she proudly bought on her own, as was documented in the show.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Mary Fitzgerald</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e1260824bb9e-selling-sunset-net-worths-2.jpg><p id=ePOk5d1PZZ3F data-wc=68>The <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>recently-promoted beauty</a></strong> is expected to be worth between $1-2 million dollars according to reports, although that figure may be slightly higher now she has been promoted to manage the other girls in the cast. Mary has definitely earned her stripes and as one of the original cast members has worked her way up the ranks, pulling in the big bucks through marketing an impressive list of properties.</p><h2><strong>Heather Rae El Moussa</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b02356d77973-selling-sunset-net-worths-3.jpg><p id=eGJNz8F2UVE6 data-wc=51>Like Mary, Heather has been on the show since its inception and has her own impressive property portfolio when it comes to her role. She is expected to be worth $3 million according to Celebrity Net Worth. Prior to starring on the show, Heather was a Playmate at the Playboy mansion&nbsp;</p><p id=eksZwFFk0JUm data-wc=61>The 35-year-old star recently married her partner of four years Tarek El Mossa, which was featured on season five of the show. The <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>former Flip or Flop star</a></strong> who used to be married to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Christina Hall</a></strong> has a whopping net worth of $15 million. Heather and Tarek welcomed a baby in January 2023 after Heather <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>announced her pregnancy</a></strong> in June 2022.</p><h2><strong>Chelsea Lazkani</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/00089b8f8146-selling-sunset-net-worths-4.jpg><p id=egQS5gTJsuhd data-wc=70>Chelsea <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>joined the Selling Sunset</a></strong> cast for season five of the popular series, and is best known for her fiery personality. Her attitude to life appears to have paid off, as the successful real estate agent has so far reportedly raised a net worth of over $500,000. While less than many of her cast mates, at just 30 years old, Chelsea has plenty of time to build up her fortune.</p><h2><strong>Christine Quinn</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2b92a552da58-selling-sunset-net-worths-5.jpg><p id=eiUPZyJvysEx data-wc=63>While the real estate star known for her rivalry with Chrishell was absent from season six of Selling Sunset and appears to have left the show for good, make no mistake that Christine is still a key part of the show's reputation. The 34-year-old's net worth is estimated to be around $3 million, which is no surprise when you consider her selling personality.&nbsp;</p><p id=eK7ct7j804T6 data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Chrishell Stause's relationship history: Who has the Selling Sunset star dated?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=efimKChSdNFW data-wc=34>Since her departure from the Netflix realtor related show, fans have speculated whether Christine may return to our screens in another reality drama such as Real Housewives.

During the 32-year-old's first season on the show, it was revealed that Nick - who shares a child with Bre - had fathered a child with another partner without telling Bre.</p><p id=e3n5ptXKPRVc data-wc=79>While this real estate agent is new to Selling Sunset, the model and fitness enthusiast's appearance on season six of the show was not her television debut. Bre appeared on Wild 'N Out first, and later showed up in episodes of Love & Listings also. As a result, her net worth is predicted to sit at the impressive number of $6 million - although it should be added that some news outlets have suggested it may be significantly lower.</p><h2><strong>Amanza Smith&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/6753e660c41a-selling-sunset-net-worths-7.jpg><p id=eMC_KEBx-q data-wc=13><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Selling Sunset stars' houses have to be seen to be believed</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=egpN5L8917 data-wc=68>This Selling Sunset star who recently made headlines for a video she released about how she was cutting Chrishell out of her life has a believed net worth of around $1 million.
