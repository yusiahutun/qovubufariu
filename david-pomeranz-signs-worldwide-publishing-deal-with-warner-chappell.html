After a time as the lead singer for the rock band East Orange Express, Pomeranz left the group. When he was still a teenager, MCA/Decca signed him to a contract that yielded two albums, New Blues and Time to Fly (the latter featuring Chick Corea), and he began touring the country as the opening act for <strong>Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, Three Dog Night</strong> and<strong> The Doors</strong>, among others.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Pomeranz collaborated with Russian rock star <strong>Alexander Malinin</strong> on “Faraway Lands,” which they performed live in Gorky Park for an episode of the television sitcom Head of the Class, the first time an American series filmed there. He also sang “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Me Now,” the television series Perfect Strangers theme song.</p><p>Pomeranz’s songs include “Tryin’ to Get the Feeling Again” and “The Old Songs,” both recorded by Manilow, and “It’s in Every One of Us,” which was featured in the TV specials John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together, Rocky Mountain Holiday and A Muppet Family Christmas, the Dave Clark musical Time, the film Big, and at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. His various songwriting projects have amassed twenty-two platinum and eighteen gold albums.</p><p>Pomeranz has composed for feature films television – earning a 1981 Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Music and Lyrics for the CBS television movie Homeward Bound&nbsp;and the stage.</p><p>Pomeranz is thrilled now to have a new worldwide administration deal with WCM, “I’ve had many of my successes working with Warner Chappell over the years, and I’m so happy to be home again with my friends there. I look forward to our continuing to create great things together in the future.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJdoaXFnlJbDqrCMqaamnaKWu7t50qKep6tdrLyzuMOwoJ2dXaXCo7jIrJ%2Bippdisaaty2auoqyYYsSivs2eqWabmJa9sbHLpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
