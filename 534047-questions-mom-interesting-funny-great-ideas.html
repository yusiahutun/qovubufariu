Ask about her favourite childhood snacks or what she misses most about growing up. Gradually move to <a href=#>deep questions</a> that will tell you about her personality.</p><h3>Deep questions to ask your mom</h3><p class=align-left>Deep questions are an excellent way of learning your mother’s mindset.
