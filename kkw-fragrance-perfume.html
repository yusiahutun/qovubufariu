To find out what real men and women—and not just the Kardashian and Jenner sisters—think of the new scent, we took a bottle of Crystal Gardenia out on the streets of New York City. Wrapped up and disguised in black tape, we had strangers give the perfume a sniff-test to see what they really thought (watch above).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Crystal Gardenia is a clean, fruity scent has an early '90s throwback quality to it. Notes include pink grapefruit, anjou pear, and water lily at the top; gardenia, tiare flower, and tuberose at the middle; sandalwood, solar amber, and musk at the base. The oud scent is a heavier version that Kardashian West says she created with the Middle East in mind, and the citrus version bursts open with orange oil and neroli for a crisper and lighter take. All three scents are available now for a very reasonable $35 and $60 depending on the size—so you might want to add more than one to your cart.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-href=https://kkwfragrance.com/collections/kkw-crystal-gardenia href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kkwfragrance.com/collections/kkw-crystal-gardenia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=SHOP class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">SHOP</a><br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Original: </strong>Kim Kardashian is taking another stab at launching her own perfume, this time under her KKW Beauty brand. The beauty mogul shared an Instagram of what are actually orchids, captioned the photo "Gardenia," and then tagged a blank Instagram account called KKW Fragrance. So I think it's safe to say that after much speculation and hint-dropping, a KKW Beauty fragrance—featuring gardenia, not orchids—is coming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian West first hinted that a new fragrance was coming months ago on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, then again backstage at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2017/06/13/how-kim-kardashian-west-bounced-back-to-45-5-million-and-a-new-cosmetics-company/#6001057f8f59 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Forbes Women's Summit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Forbes Women's Summit</a> earlier this summer. We even got a look at what appears to be tester bottles on her Snapchat in June. The Snap showed papers labelled KKW Crystal in the background, plus little baggies of crystals on the table. Perhaps the KKW Fragrance will be crystal-themed? Only time will tell. Kardashian told Forbes that we can expect a fragrance by the end of 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gardenia is clearly one of Kardashian's favorite notes, since it was prominent in her first eponymous fragrance launch back in 2010. She described her original scent as "Jasmine, gardenia, tubarose! Its so me! Lol," on Twitter that same year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We will update this post with more information as it comes to light. In the meantime, you can still shop Kardashian's old perfumes—which have a cult-like fan following, including by her half-sister Kylie Jenner–online now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kim Kardashian for Women, $18.27, amazon.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003654SVS data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=SHOP data-vars-ga-product-id=91ba324a-2508-4cd2-882c-3917898dcbf3 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003654SVS data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003654SVS data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003654SVS data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Kim Kardashian" data-vars-ga-product-price=$22.25 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=218e594f-0d85-41ef-b79c-ea6508725e6a data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Kim Kardashian" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Eau de Parfum" class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">SHOP</a><br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAamlrbGNohHp7yqSuZp6ilrSzrc2cnGaolaeztrnEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
