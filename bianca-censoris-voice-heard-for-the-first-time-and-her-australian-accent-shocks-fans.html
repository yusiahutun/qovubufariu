The 29-year-old hails from Australia, which many fans forgot, or were unaware of due to the lack of hearing her voice. However, an old video has now resurfaced on the web and fans are shocked at the sound of <a href=#>Bianca Censori</a>‘s accent.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bianca-censori-s-voice-heard-for-first-time-in-throwback-video>Bianca Censori’s voice heard for ‘first time’ in throwback video</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2032964675-1024x769.jpg><p>During her time at Yeezy, Bianca spoke at the CFS Summit in Paris, France to represent the brand, and a clip is now recirculating the internet.</p><p>“I’m an architectural designer from Melbourne, Australia,” she can be heard saying in the throwback clip. “I currently reside in Los Angeles, and I’m a lead architectural designer at Yeezy.”</p><p>She then goes on to explain her accomplishments during her time there, working with designers such as “James Turell, Valerio Olgiati and Vincent Van Duysen.”</p><p>“My passion for architecture lies in fabrication, conceptualizing the future of built space, and exploring the bridge between the physical and the meta,” the clip concluded.</p><p>Fans hearing her voice for the first time were shocked, as some joked they ‘didn’t realize she had a voice’.</p><p>“It’s wild that this is the first time hearing her voice,” wrote one Reddit user.</p><p>“Oh, she sounds normal. The LA valley girl up talk has gotten to her a bit, but aside from that she sounds normal,” penned another.</p><p>“I love how she talks! I’m a sucker for Aussie accents, though,” a third wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-s-voice-isn-t-the-only-thing-that-shocks-fans>The star’s voice isn’t the only thing that shocks fans</h2><p>As well as her voice, fans were also shocked at the star’s ‘unrecognizable’ appearance, which has drastically changed since she’s been with Ye.</p><p>In the clip, Bianca had long brown hair, as opposed to her current short lo ks. At one point, Ye’s wife died her hair blond as she sported a ‘pixie cut’.</p><p>Although viewers couldn’t see what she was wearing in the clip, it’s highly unlikely she was following the <a href=#>fashion</a> trends she does today.</p><p>The star has been gaining attention for her ‘wild outfits’, as she was recently papped walked along the street in a pair of <a href=#>neon see-through tights</a>, leaving bystanders in disbelief.</p><p>However, she did cover up with a fur coat when out recently with Kanye’s eldest child, North West after reports Kim Kardashian didn’t want her to dress ‘how she usually does’ in front of the kids.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eFcK7ImqWcmV2Ysq%2B%2FzqugrGWmpLaksYyhnJqqlGKzsL6MrZ%2BeZZaev7TAjK2gpp1dlruleceeqWaZpajBs63LopinZZGYsKa602aqoaeToMBussCnqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
