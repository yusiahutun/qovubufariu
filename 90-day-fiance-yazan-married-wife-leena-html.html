After a four-month engagement, Yazan and his bride, Leena (also known as Luna), officially tied the knot. While it seems that Yazan is only posting certain photos of himself at the ceremony, some photos are surfacing of the 21-year-old bride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Yazan-on-90-Day-Fiancé-The-Other-Way-Season-2.jpeg><h2 id=h-yazan-gets-engaged-to-leena-after-messy-breakup-with-brittany>Yazan gets engaged to Leena after messy breakup with Brittany</h2><p id=par-2_87>Yazan announced his <a href=#>engagement to his then-fiancée Leena</a> on the discovery+ 90 Day Fiancé spinoff show, Bares All. Yazan appears on the episode alongside his translator and friend, Adam, who explains what Yazan has been up to since his breakup with his <a href=#>ex-fiancée Brittany Banks</a>. Fans will remember Yazan’s ex, Brittany, from Palm Beach, Florida, who traveled all the way to <a href=#>Jordan to visit Yazan</a> on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 2. However, after many cultural differences and cheating rumors, the two split up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_34>Adam confirmed Yazan’s new relationship, saying, “I wouldn’t say they’re dating; basically, they’re engaged. Yes, they are engaged. He already asked her hand in marriage from her father. He agreed. Her name is Leena.”</p><p id=par-4_38><a href=#>Brittany accused Yazan of cheating</a> on her with a woman, but that woman isn’t Leena, Yazan confirmed. He said, “I am talking with Leena… after Brittany started accusing me of cheating. It happened after they officially broke up.”</p><h2 id=h-who-is-yazan-s-new-bride-leena-luna>Who is Yazan’s new bride, Leena (Luna)?</h2><p id=par-5_88>With all of the <a href=#>messy Brittany drama</a> behind Yazan, he can now enter his new life with his wife, Leena. While there’s very little information about who Yazan’s new bride is, what fans do know is that she’s also American, like Brittany. Yazan tells TLC cameras that Leena is 21 years old and originally from Tennesee. Yazan also revealed on 90 Day Diaries that she has ethnic roots from Jordan. However, with Leena’s Instagram set to private, there are very few photos of Leena on the internet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCGAAXm9_Q4&t=1s</p></figure><p id=par-6_45>A blogger on Instagram, @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90daythemelanatedway</a>, posted some photos of Leena to her page. Some fans thought that the woman in the photo looked like former 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast member Ariela, who was on the same season as Yazan and Brittany.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-next-for-90-day-fianc-s-yazan-and-leena>What’s next for 90 Day Fiancé’s Yazan and Leena</h2><p id=par-7_88>While the marriage of Yazan and Leena is still very new, there are a few things we can expect from the couple. Yazan got married to his new bride in his home country of Jordan. Yazan posted a video of himself in his Instagram story of him and Leena in a white convertible as they drive off into their new life together. The video showed a sign in the foreground of a desert landscape written in Arabic, which confirms that they got married in Yazan’s home country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/90-Day-Fiancé-The-Other-Way-Yazan.jpeg><p id=par-8_114>Yazan did reveal that he would like to eventually move to America to be with Leena after she’s done with her studies. This is a complete 180 from what he said to his ex-fiancé, Brittany. He told her constantly that he wasn’t interested in leaving his family in Jordan. Now, Yazan is excited about his new life in America with his new bride. <a href=#>Even his father,</a> who threatened to kill Yazan if he married Brittany, was supportive of the marriage to Leena and his upcoming emigration to America. However, it’s likely going to take some time for Leena to petition for a spousal visa for Yazan to be with her in the US.</p><p id=par-9_92>While Yazan was open to TLC cameras following him around while he attempted to work out his relationship issues with Brittany, it seems that Yazan is keeping his life on the down-low now. While he sometimes appears on 90 Day Fiancé spinoffs like Pillow Talk, Bares All, and 90 Day Diaries, it’s could be a while before we get another Yazan and Leena update. However, now that they will be a part of the emigration process, it’s possible fans could see the newlyweds on an upcoming season of 90 Day Fiancé.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjLKYs5meYrqivtGinJ1lp56zpnnLnpynmV6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
