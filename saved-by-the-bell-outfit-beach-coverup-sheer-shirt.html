K<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>elly Kapowski's crop tops</a> are still so clear in my mind, and it's hard to think of Zach Morris without remembering his affinity for striped shirts. Still, Lisa Turtle was clearly the most fashion-forward of this friend group. Every one of her outfits included some sort of bold accessory — extra-large earrings, a colorful hat, a scarf worn as a headband, etc. And, there's one particular look from Season 3's "Cut Day" that I haven't stopped thinking about for years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I came across this episode a few short years ago, when my parents were watching reruns on a Saturday morning. Of course, Zach was technically the focus — he was trying to avoid suspension, and therefore had to sneak around to meet his friends who were cutting class — but once he escaped school and arrived at the beach, my eyes were on Lisa and her sweet bathing suit cover-up.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This character was never subtle in her clothing choices, so naturally she was sitting in the sand wearing a long, sheer purple shirt that matched a purple, polka-dot one-piece underneath. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>monochromatic look</a> was paired with statement jewels — a necklace, large studs, and a bracelet — and while it probably wasn't the best for a day of swimming, I still felt the urge to copy it, ASAP.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately, I found the episode online and took a screenshot, saving it to my phone as inspiration. It's the perfect replacement for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>old, oversized T-shirt</a> I would typically wear over my swimsuits, and definitely fits my love of whimsical, joyful style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I admittedly haven't found the right time to copy it — and am cautious of beach trips due to the pandemic — I still plan to give it a try, even if just on my parents' balcony. I already own the cutest printed swimsuit from Summersalt x Tanya Taylor ($125; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>tanyataylor.com</a>) and when styled with an organza shirt from Simon Miller ($290; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>nordstrom.com</a>) it's a modern 2020 take that's just as fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0rdWem2aaqWLBqbGMm5ylpF2kwrWyyK1km52RmLVur86vnKutoGLAqbHEq2SsoJmnwQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
