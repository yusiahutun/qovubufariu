"He knows what I like and what I don't – he'll know straight away without me even needing to see the piece, whether or not I would love it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We caught up with Jobson after her big night, where she opened up about her confidence to wear just about anything, her love for the Nineties and the model whose style she can't get enough of.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Please talk us through your BAFTA look</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was in head-to-toe Prada with some beautiful Cartier jewellery. I was really excited about this look, when I put the dress on, I knew straight away that it was the one. It's so exciting to be dressed by Prada, I hope that this is going to be a beautiful and long relationship between the two of us. I'm so happy everybody wants to be a part of this with me."</p><img alt="jasmine jobson" title="jasmine jobson " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atalexjpiper-039a6926-646364d35ebac.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ALEXANDER PIPER</span></p><img alt="jasmine jobson" title="jasmine jobson " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atalexjpiper-039a6938-646365126dbf0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ALEXANDER PIPER</span></p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How do you decide which brands you want to work with and how involved are you in the styling process?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I tend to leave it up to my stylist, Shaquille [Ross-Williams], but of course, I have some influence. He's absolutely amazing and has me right down to a T, he knows me inside out. I love working with him, it's a beautiful thing. We've been working together for around two to three years now, so we've had plenty of time to get to know each other. He knows what I like and what I don't – he'll know straight away without me even needing to see the piece, whether or not I would love it. We've got a wonderful relationship and I'm very lucky. I'm all about trust and loyalty, so we are a very close-knit team that meshes together so well – we make magic."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What kind of fashion makes you feel your most confident?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm going to be completely honest and say anything. When you're coming up in the theatre world, you have to wear costumes, and on TV you have to wear loads of different outfits, some of which you wouldn't necessarily be wearing yourself. So for me, by expanding my comfort zone I can actually put on anything and feel comfortable in it. I always joke with my agent and say one day I'm going to do a red carpet wearing a black bag and make it look beautiful."</p><img alt="jasmine jobson" title="Jasmine Jobson " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atalexjpiper-039a6869-646366673f111.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ALEXANDER PIPER</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How has your style evolved?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's definitely evolved over the past few years. I'm a Nineties baby so I love everything Nineties regarding clothes and fashion."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What has been your most memorable fashion moment in recent years and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's too much to choose from, I'd say just the last couple of years have been so memorable as my fashion and style have completely changed. I recently wore a Stella McCartney dress which I fell in love with as it fitted me like a glove, which felt like a big moment. The last few years have been really beautiful for me, I'm so excited to see where we go next."</p><img alt="jasmine jobson" title="Vogue & Netflix Celebrate The BAFTA TV Awards" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jasmine-jobson-attends-the-vogue-netflix-party-in-news-photo-1684237314.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David M.

She's absolutely stunning and her dress sense is unmatched. It's no coincidence that she's styled by Shaquille, as she's really on top of her game. He is an amazing stylist."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What is your ideal getting-ready set-up?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Exactly what I did for the BAFTAs – I had my team at the Londoner Hotel, who were so gracious to host me. All I need is my team and beautiful people around me, sometimes a Mimosa to get the Dutch courage going. Good music and good people is what it's all about."</p><img alt="jasmine jobson" title="jasmine jobson " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atalexjpiper-039a6803-1-6463659f829af.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ALEXANDER PIPER</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">When do you feel most beautiful?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"All the time. Especially when I'm getting ready for these types of events alongside my team, putting Shaquille together with my make-up artist Kareem [Jarché] was probably the best thing I've done for myself. By the time they're finished with me, I look like an absolute goddess. My team are the dream team."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Fashion has a reputation for being frivolous, but why does what we wear matter?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Fashion matters. What we wear is a statement of who we are, this is something I 100 per cent believe in.
