I wanted to silence them,” Taylor wrote. “You see – in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut shaming – the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today. The jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath. The media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian era.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This led Taylor to "focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships." She added, "If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that right? I would learn later on that people could and people would."&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in the letter, Taylor thanked fans who didn't buy into the tabloid fodder, writing: "Maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in childhood.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't the first time Swift has addressed speculation about her sexuality. Back in 2019, she confirmed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a> that she wasn't a part of the LGBTQ+ community after people thought her song "Me!" was her way of coming out as queer. Speaking about her intention behind the track, Swift explained: "Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male. I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZJuho5rFtq3LZqmupZ%2BnwG59mHFwZqyRrrmwvoyvnKurmaS7boSScWpuamk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
