She was the youngest poet in the country's known history, presenting at a time unlike any her predecessors have faced.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gorman, 22, was asked to write a poem to symbolize all that Biden stands for—a poem about unity. But in the wake of four years under President Donald Trump, a time no one would describe as united, Gorman told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/books/amanda-gorman-inauguration-hill-we-climb.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a>, "I'm not going to in any way gloss over what we’ve seen over the past few weeks and, dare I say, the past few years." Her poem, titled "The Hill We Climb," was universally praised, earning her enormous presales of her three upcoming books; nabbing her a modeling contract with IMG; and earning her a reading spot during the Super Bowl LV.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two years after her monumental entry into the spotlight, Gorman is still using poetry to raise awareness of America's unspoken history as well as the nation's current hopes and struggles. Here's who the poet is and why she was born for such a moment as this.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Gorman was named the Youth Poet Laureate of Los Angeles at 16.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born and raised in Los Angeles, Gorman discovered her talent for poetry when she was still very young. A third-grade teacher captured her attention with Ray Bradbury's poem "Dandelion Wine," according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-17/amanda-gorman-biden-inauguration-poet data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Los Angeles Times</a>, and started her on a path to spend nearly every waking moment journaling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Quickly gaining attention with her work about race, feminism, and the struggle for civil rights, she was named the Youth Poet Laureate of Los Angeles in 2014, and published her first poetry collection, "The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough," in 2015. Then, while studying sociology at Harvard University, she was named the first National Youth Poet Laureate in the United States.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Dr. Jill Biden discovered her work.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The new First Lady was the one who stumbled upon Gorman's work only days before the inauguration. She was watching a reading Gorman gave at the Library of Congress, according to the Times, when she asked if Gorman might read something for the inauguration. Over a Zoom call, she was told she'd been picked to present, and she'd need to be on a flight to Washington, D.C., soon.</p><img alt="amanda gorman at 2nd annual care impact awards dinner" title="2nd Annual CARE Impact Awards Dinner" width=2400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/honoree-amanda-gorman-attends-the-2nd-annual-care-impact-news-photo-1611158881.?resize=320:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dimitrios Kambouris</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gorman, 2019</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They did not want to put up guardrails for me at all,” Gorman told the Times. “The theme for the inauguration in its entirety is ‘America United,’ so when I heard that was their vision, that made it very easy for me to say, great, that’s also what I wanted to write about in my poem, about America united, about a new chapter in our country.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She struggled to finish "The Hill We Climb" until the night of the Capitol insurrection.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While writing her poem, she listened to music that put her "in a historic and epic mind-set," she told the Los Angeles Times, including the soundtracks from Netflix series The Crown, as well as the soundtrack from Hamilton. But in the weeks coming up to Wednesday, January 20, Gorman hit a roadblock. The pressure to write something so inspiring it would transform a nation, à la Abraham Lincoln's or Martin Luther King Jr.'s addresses, was Herculean. It wasn't until she watched a pro-Trump mob descend on the Capitol earlier this month that she was able to finish "The Hill We Climb."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After watching Confederate flags stormed through the seat of American government, she added the lines, "We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy / And this effort very nearly succeeded / But while democracy can be periodically delayed / It can never be permanently defeated."</p><img alt="amanda gorman at together live new york city" title="Together Live - New York City" width=3000 height=2156 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-gorman-speaks-on-stage-during-together-live-at-town-news-photo-1611158942.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Astrid Stawiarz</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gorman, 2019</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Gorman has opened up about having a speech impediment.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like the 46th president, Gorman has a speech impediment she has worked to overcome. "The writing process is its own excruciating form, but as someone with a speech impediment, speaking in front of millions of people presents its own type of terror," Gorman told the Times as she prepared for the inauguration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She described <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2021/01/19/958077401/history-has-its-eyes-on-us-poet-amanda-gorman-seeks-right-words-for-inauguration data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to NPR" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">to NPR</a> that, as a child, she struggled to pronounce certain letters of the alphabet, such as the letter R, and therefore had to constantly "self-edit and self-police."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she first started performing, she worried over which words to include in her poems, fearing that she might not be able to say them correctly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I would be in the bathroom scribbling five minutes before trying to figure out if I could say 'Earth' or if I can say 'girl' or if I can say 'poetry,'" she told NPR. "And you know, doing the best with the poem I could."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She draws courage from the poets who have come before her—especially Angelou, who was mute as a child. "I think there is a real history of orators who have had to struggle, a type of imposed voicelessness, you know, having that stage at inauguration," Gorman says. "So it's really special for me."</p><img alt="amanda gorman and morgan freeman at we day california to celebrate young people changing the world" title="WE Day California To Celebrate Young People Changing The World" width=1024 height=757 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-gorman-and-morgan-freeman-speak-onstage-at-we-day-news-photo-1611159056.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Allen Berezovsky</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gorman with Morgan Freeman, 2018</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She intends to run for president.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-17/amanda-gorman-biden-inauguration-poet data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Los Angeles Times</a>, Gorman plans to run for president in 2036, the first election cycle when she'll be old enough to campaign.
