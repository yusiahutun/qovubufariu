Master Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-florenz-mendoza-5489402-(1).jpg><p>The most basic shortcuts like <strong>Ctrl + C </strong>(Copy),<strong> Ctrl + V</strong> (Paste), and <strong>Ctrl + A </strong>(Select All) on Windows were probably drilled into your head since high school. Other than these most common ones, you can memorize other keyboard shortcuts you usually use. For example, <strong>Ctrl + Backspace </strong>on Windows deletes the whole word you just typed, so you don’t have to hit backspace multiple times.</p><p>If you’re using a Mac after coming from Windows, the keyboard might get confusing because of a few subtle differences. For instance, the <strong>Command</strong> key takes the place of the <strong>Windows</strong> key. To help you with this, you can read our <a href=#>guide to common and helpful keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Mac</a>. Master the specific keyboard shortcuts depending on your OS to help you type faster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=practice-on-online-typing-platforms>2. Practice on Online Typing Platforms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-13.jpg><p>A few simple exercises every day can help you type more quickly. There are <a href=#>sites to learn or practice faster touch typing on computers</a>. Aside from teaching basic typing skills, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Typing Club by EdClub</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Typing.com</a> also includes typing games to help you learn while having fun.</p><p>Researchers from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aalto University and the University of Cambridge</a> say you don’t need to learn touch typing to type more quickly. However, you can use these online typing tests to track your performance and identify common mistakes you make. Be ready for a new challenge, and avoid practice tests you've already mastered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-rsquo-t-look-at-your-keyboard>3. Don’t Look at Your Keyboard</h2><p>Looking at your keyboard and hands while typing reduces your typing speed. You need to develop muscle memory to type faster. To memorize your keyboard layout, avoid looking down. But if you really can’t resist, cover the set of keys you want to learn with tape. Or better yet, buy a keyboard with blank keycaps.</p><p>If you’re using a QWERTY keyboard, we recommend starting with the home row (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, <strong>J</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, <strong>L</strong>, <strong>;</strong>). The <strong>F</strong> and <strong>J</strong> keys usually have small bumps to help position your fingers on the correct keys. If you're only a beginner, don't use typing tests that allow you to practice and type only sentences. We recommend using an online typing test that helps you memorize each key’s position first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=use-text-expansion-or-predictive-text>4. Use Text Expansion or Predictive Text</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-14.jpg><p>Text expansion and predictive text are time-saving features when you’re at a loss for words. The technology suggests logical words, phrases, or sentences based on the other words and letters you've typed. All you have to do is tap on the word, type on the keyboard, or hit enter or tab, depending on the tool that you’re using.</p><h2 id=enable-autocorrection>5. Enable Autocorrection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-11.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Word processors often have tools to automatically correct your spelling or turn plain text into the right symbols. For instance, you can turn on autocorrection features in Google Docs. Go to <strong>Tools</strong> in the toolbar and then click <strong>Preferences. </strong>Under <strong>General</strong>, <strong>Automatically correct spelling</strong> should be checked. Click <strong>Substitutions</strong>, which is also under <strong>Preferences</strong>. Here, you can customize automatic substitutions.</p><h2 id=learn-markdown>6. Learn Markdown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-10.jpg><p>Markdown is a markup language that easily lets you create formatted text for the internet. It allows you to turn plain text into bold, italic, blockquotes, headers, or links without clicking on your mouse. This function is useful when you want to get into a natural typing flow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not all Markdown writing is fast. For instance, typing <strong>**</strong>bold<strong>**</strong> in Markdown automatically turns the text inside the asterisks into <strong>bold</strong>. That’s not as fast as just hitting <strong>Ctrl + B</strong>. But starting a line with the greater than sign <strong>></strong> to make blockquotes or using hashtags <strong>##</strong> to make an <strong>H2</strong> heading in Markdown is much faster.</p><p>To learn Markdown, you can just read <a href=#>our guide on Markdown if you're a beginner</a>. Afterward, you can start practicing on the <a href=#>best free online Markdown editors and converters</a> like Obsidian or StackEdit. Once you get used to Markdown, you'll love the faster typing experience.</p><h2 id=transition-to-a-colemak-keyboard-layout>7. Transition to a Colemak Keyboard Layout</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-9.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let’s admit it; QWERTY belongs to the list of <a href=#>outdated technologies and the professions that still use them</a>. Its first documented appearance was in 1878, when it became the industry standard for typewriters. Colemak markets itself as the modern alternative to your QWERTY keyboard.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colemak</a> claims that their keyboard layout “will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life”. Your hand jumps rows 16 times more on a QWERTY than on a Colemak. You can also type 35 times more words using Colemak’s home row. If you type in English, consider switching to Colemak for faster touch typing.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Colemak for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unix</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=listen-to-ambient-or-instrumental-music>8. Listen to Ambient or Instrumental Music</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Do you like listening to music while you work? The wrong type of music can be intrusive and distracting, especially if you’re not an expert typist. A research paper from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">22nd International Conference on Auditory Display</a> shows that beginner typists should use low-volume music with no vocals to maintain high-performance levels. Stick to ambient or instrumental music at the right volume when you’re typing.</p><h2 id=change-your-typing-style>9. Change Your Typing Style</h2><p>Your keyboarding style affects your typing performance. An article from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting</a> says that the number of fingers you use, wrist and hand postures, body, and the force you use in hitting the keys affect typing speed. You have to “float” your wrists, use moderate or high pressure, avoid changing the angle of your palm, and use more fingers if you want to increase your typing speed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, researchers at Aalto University (shown in the video above) found that the number of fingers you use doesn’t matter much. You can use two fingers to type. However, they also found that steady hands, using the same fingers for the same keys, and looking at the keys less improve typing performance.</p><p>Another way to type faster is to use the rollover typing technique. This technique requires you to press the next key before releasing the previous key. Fast typists’ hands steadily move across the keyboard and press the next key within milliseconds. However, you can only do this if you memorize your keyboard layout.</p><h2 id=stick-with-a-comfortable-keyboard>10. Stick With a Comfortable Keyboard</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Are you motivated by the loud clicks on a mechanical keyboard motivating? Or do you find the sound distracting? Or maybe you prefer keys with a soft feel? Whatever your preference, choose a keyboard that's comfortable for typing. When you’ve found the perfect keyboard, practice with it until you reach your best typing speed.</p><p>If you use a laptop, it’s better to use an external keyboard for typing. There are <a href=#>pros and cons of using an external keyboard</a>. While harder to lug around when traveling, an external keyboard is more ergonomic than a laptop’s. A laptop’s keyboard is usually cramped, which may slow your typing speed.</p><h2 id=take-an-online-typing-course>11.
