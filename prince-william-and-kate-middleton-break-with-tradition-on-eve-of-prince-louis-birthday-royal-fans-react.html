It is something of a royal tradition that royal birthdays are celebrated by the release of photographs. Catherine has taken a great many and they are always eagerly awaited.</p><p id=ee9rKzPlOEW data-wc=43>"This is a shame because of the vexed issue of her Mothering Day photograph. The revelation that it was edited led to a highly embarrassing contretemps and the subsequent revelation that she was not only recovering from abdominal surgery but bravely fighting cancer.</p><p id=ehR_vYJYNmG data-wc=57>"The video message when she revealed this was probably the bravest by any public figure about their health in Britain. The lack of a photograph on this occasion simply emphasises her need for time, space, and privacy which she expressed so movingly in the message and, after the misunderstandings of recent weeks, this should be universally understood."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9cbf5d3ff0c-kate-middleton-louis-scouts.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Kate's tradition of baking a cake</h2><p id=e-_fzuYc5O1 data-wc=33>Back in 2019, when appearing on with Mary Berry, Kate shared that her favorite tradition was baking a cake to commemorate her kids' birthdays at the stroke of midnight.</p><p id=en1Uqek_1IC data-wc=39>"I love making the cake," the mum-of-three gushed. "It's become a bit of a tradition that I stay up 'til midnight with ridiculous amounts of cake mix and icing and I make far too much. But I love it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea6cd9888ad4-gettyimages-1400704437.jpg><p id=eISCbNcGPRf data-wc=28>She also revealed that her other two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, were just as ready to get their hands messy and contribute to their baking adventures.</p><p id=eSBa0T9mR9D data-wc=30>"I've done that with George and Charlotte â€“ making pizza dough," Kate told the former judge. "They love it because they can get their hands messy."</p><h2>Louis' private birthday celebrations</h2><p id=edRGrP9gdeG data-wc=23>Louis goes to Lambrook School in Berkshire with his brother and sister and has recently returned to the classroom after the Easter break.</p><p id=eHs8X-wTh0 data-wc=26>It is likely a family birthday celebration, perhaps involving the Prince's grandparents Carole and Michael Middleton, will be held after the youngster's school day is over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45faa8830db7-gettyimages-1243027787.jpg><h2>His cheeky public appearances</h2><p id=eX-ywJTuPEl data-wc=37>William and Kate's youngest child is fourth in line to the throne and was born on St George's Day, April 23, 2018, at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, weighing 8lb 7oz.</p><p id=eZU9cux0Ha2 data-wc=30>He was christened Louis Arthur Charles at 11 weeks old, by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace in front of friends and family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c85e8ca02d2-prince-louis-salute.jpg><p id=euB7tFBuDE data-wc=59>In his short, yet eventful life, Louis has joined his family on a few public outings and never fails to become a talking point due to his playful nature. His most memorable appearances so far have been monkeying around at the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee Pageant, where he was seen pulling faces and playing on his mum Kate's lap.&nbsp;</p><p id=e319aG01mG data-wc=38>He's also displayed some lively facial expressions during his various Trooping the Colour appearances, including in 2023, when he appeared to be shouting and covering his ears as the RAF military flypast whizzed over the Buckingham Palace balcony.</p><h2>Louis' 'wild side'</h2><p id=eHqAYnirbN data-wc=17>Princess Diana's astrologer and confidante, Debbie Frank, explained that Louis' "wild side" was written in the stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=e30tCBpqVx data-wc=53>Speaking exclusively to <strong>HELLO!</strong>, she said: "Louis is born to be his own person. His birth chart doesn't share the astrological blueprint usually associated with the steadfast, sensible sign of Taurus. Louis's Taurus qualities are overlit by Uranus, the wild child planet, which was positioned close to his Sun when he was born. &nbsp;</p><p data-wc=30 id=eJLrPl1X7dD>"This means that he is disinclined to follow the herd (in this case royal protocol). He is likely to shake things up, add some mischief and disruption into the mix."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b63ea10eb8f1-louis-shushes-kate.jpg><p data-wc=64 id=erapuIyy5q>Describing Louis as a "breath of fresh air" who "provides some light relief from the stiff and staid royal line-up," she added: "<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>He's so engaging, playful, cheeky</a>, and utterly himself that people fall in love with his court jester antics. He is guaranteed to put a smile on everyone's faces, even though he is openly seen to remonstrate with his parents at royal events.</p><p data-wc=46 id=eRJ12d_GQ6n>"His is an affectionate and loving personality with Venus in Taurus, Cancer rising, and the Moon in Leo. He is a crowd pleaser even though he breaks the royal mould. Adorable and engaging, he is easily forgiven, and his attractive personality magnetises a lot of attention."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b279732d1ce3-gettyimages-1401294241.jpg><h2 data-wc=46>The one person to make Kate 'lose her cool'</h2><p data-wc=19 id=e8VC73YqUp>Debbie also noted that young Louis is the one person who can <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>make his mother Kate "lose her cool"</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-wc=44 id=eu2fE21mYa>"Undoubtedly, Louis' determined Mars in Capricorn creates a fractious frisson with Kate's Sun in the same sign. He is the one person who can make her lose her cool! Kate is very self-disciplined and taming her little tiger cub is a challenge for her."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
