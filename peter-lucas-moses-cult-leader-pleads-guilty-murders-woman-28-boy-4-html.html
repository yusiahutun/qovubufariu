57.<br></span></p><p><span>She lived at 2622 Ashe Street until early this year.</span></p><p><span>Ms McKoy was shot just before Christmas in 2010 after Moses learned she could not have children and

several times, killing her, prosecutors said.</span></p><p><span>The group threw a party a few days later where Moses showed the woman's body to his mother, sister, Shiela Moses, 20, and brother P.
