Their Hollywood journey, coupled with their walk through life as each other’s companion and ability to sustain their bond for over 43 years has ultimately <a href=#>redefined sisterhood</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Growing_Up_Strong></span><strong>Growing Up Strong</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tia and Tamera Mowry came into the world on July 6 1978 in Gelnhausen, West Germany. They grew up with their parents Darlene Renee Mowry and Timothy Mowry who recognized their kids’ potential at a young age and supported them through pageants and talent shows.</p><p>Knowing they wanted nothing more than acting, the twins worked together to convince their parents to move to California. The family eventually moved, on the condition the then-twelve-year-olds would land acting gigs within a month. They did, and their careers took off from there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Throughout their rise to stardom, Tia and Tamera maintained their close bonds, which kept them grounded. Tia once revealed that the traditional upbringing they received contributed to keeping them on the right track without controversy.</p><p>That, and knowing exactly when to take a break. Notably, the sisters remained committed to their education despite their Hollywood successes. After obtaining their GED, the duo took a temporary hiatus to obtain their degrees from Pepperdine University.</p><p>Tia admitted their decision to attend college and obtain degrees in psychology contributed to keeping them sensible and balanced. Hence, Hollywood was glad to welcome the duo with open arms when they returned to showbiz to pick up where they left off.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CSister_Sister%E2%80%9D_Gave_Them_The_Perfect_Foundation></span><strong>“Sister, Sister” Gave Them The Perfect Foundation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tia and Tamera’s Hollywood careers have seen the twins work together on various occasions. But their stint in the 90s sitcom “Sister, Sister,” remains the defining moment of their career.</p><p>The pair starred as Tia Landry and Tamera Campbell, identical twins who were separated at birth and forced to grow up with adoptive parents. When they met years later, they forged a bond so strong that their adoptive parents could not say no to having them live together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Although identical, the duo had varying personalities. Tia, played by Tia Mowry-Hardrict was the studious, intelligent twin while Tamera Mowry-Housley played the mischievous, boy-crazy sister Tamera Campbell.</p><p>With their contrasting personalities and resulting drama, the duo won the hearts of viewers around the world, shooting them to superstardom and painting sisterhood in a new light.</p><p>In a 2017 interview, Tia admitted how much she wanted the series to return to the screen for a sequel. However, her ideal definition of a “Sister, Sister” revival was one that celebrated the power of sisterhood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Walking_In_Each_Others_Shadows></span><strong>Walking In Each Other’s Shadows</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Their roles on “Sister, Sister” paved the way for Tia and Tamera to star in other notable movies. Most of these movies tapped into the numerous potential of their sisterhood, especially as identical twins.</p><p>Some of their joint projects include “Twitches,” “Twitches Too,” and the 00s television movie “Seventeen Again,” where they played relatives, but not sisters.</p><p>Additionally, Tia made a guest appearance in her sister’s lifetime show, “Strong Medicine,” playing the twin sister of Tamera’s character. The two also ventured into music in their youth, managed by their mom as part of the band, “Voices.” However, they gave up their musical pursuits after releasing just one unsuccessful album.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In 2011 the sisters gave fans a glimpse into their lives on “Tia And Tamera,” which aired on Style network. The reality show went off the air in 2013 after three seasons.</p><p>Years later, Tamera revealed why she and her sister decided to quit the show. According to her, the producers wanted them to introduce artificial drama which would portray African-American women in a negative light. They opted to quit rather than go against their values.</p><p>They’ve also co-written a series of books, focusing on twins bond, their extraordinary connection, and the power of family and sisterhood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sibling_Therapy_Has_Its_Benefits></span><strong>Sibling Therapy Has Its Benefits</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Staying true to each other for so long does not mean they never encountered differences or difficult moments. However, going for <a href=#>sibling therapy</a> when they seemed to have lost that connection has helped them sustain their sisterly love.</p><p>Viewers experienced one of such moments in an episode of their reality show titled “Failure To Communicate,” in 2011. The twins seemed distant in the episode, a far cry from their usual inseparable relationship.</p><p>Before the episode ended, Tia and Tamera had to seek help from a therapist to retrace their connection. Discussing their relationship and the dwindling connection helped the duo learn to communicate positively.</p><p>The sisters later reflected on that episode, saying it was their way of showing the world they weren’t always perfect. Their lives admittedly changed for good afterward, as they each learned to always expect the best from each other, a mindset that has sustained their sisterhood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Enduring_Their_Longest_Separation></span><strong>Enduring Their Longest Separation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>2020 was a particularly trying year for the sisters. The two admittedly spent six months physically away from each other due to the pandemic. During an interview in 2020, Tamera Mowry-Housley got emotional as she discussed how difficult it was to have gone over six months without seeing Tia.</p><p>The 43-year-old also admitted the period was the longest she’d ever spent separated from her sister. They finally got their chance to reunite months later in what Tia described as a tearful reunion.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=They_Keep_Their_Families_Close></span><strong>They Keep Their Families Close</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tia Mowry-Hardrict and her sister Tamera Mowry-Housley <a href=#>have come a long way</a> since their days on “Sister, Sister.” One major milestone they scaled is starting their own families.</p><p>Both are happily married to their significant others, with Tia marrying actor Cory Hardrict in 2008 while Tamera tied the knot with Adam Housley in 2011. The duo has also welcomed two kids each with their respective partners.</p><p>Notably, motherhood has significantly brought the sisters closer to each other, further strengthening their bond. During a 2018 interview, Tia opened up about how the shared bond of motherhood has positively impacted their <a href=#>relationship</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Their lives as mothers notably taught the sisters the value of prioritizing family. To ensure they keep the bond alive, they let their kids play together so they’d get along well and grow up as siblings.</p><p>They also enjoy family vacations together in addition to occasional family visits, shared dinners, and feasting together on special occasions like birthdays and Thanksgiving.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tia_And_Tamera_Mowry_Embrace_Their_Differences></span><strong>Tia And Tamera Mowry Embrace Their Differences</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Just like their contrasting characters on “Sister, Sister,” Tia and Tamera have varying personalities in real life.</p><p>Yet, the pressure to portray the perfect twins to the world has not stopped the sisters from accepting their differences and embracing them wholly. One major way they differ is in their parenting tactics.</p><p>During a 2019 interview, the “Baggage Claim” actress reflected on these differences, saying her sister adopted the traditional method of parenting her kids, but she doesn’t. Additionally, while she (Tia) made a point of co-sleeping with her kids, Tamera shied away from it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Seeing as both women have managed to raise adorable kids, it appears no method supersedes the other. What’s important is that the twins are willing to learn from each other, give each other advice, develop themselves and nudge each other in the right direction when they seem to be going astray. That’s the ultimate climax of sisterhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaqtjJqlnWWklrqmvsBmpKivoq56s7HDnp2ippWZerS10q2cq6CfpLFurc2dZKGdoprAbrTOsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
