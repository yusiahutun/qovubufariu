First of all, I'm jealous. Second of all, you'll want to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pack wisely</a>: There's so much to see and do in Greece and its islands that you want to be prepared for a variety of activities. Depending on when you visit, the temperature can really vary (50° F as the lowest in winter months, and 100° F or more in the summer), but in general you're looking at warm weather outfits. You'll want to think strategically about how to dress for a variety of temperatures, including smart layering options and practical shoes. Whether you're planning on spending some time on the beach, shopping all day, going to all the historical sites you can find, taking a day trip to an island, or wandering the cobblestones aimlessly and buying a huge bouquet of flowers for your hotel room—or all of the above—we've got outfit options you can use to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>pack the perfect suitcase</a> for your Greek sojourn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling—the perfect vacation outfits await you!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-walking-around-the-neighborhood></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Walking Around the Neighborhood</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On your first day, you may just want to take in the sights near your hotel/Airbnb, with the potential for a little shopping and eating. A simple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white dress or outfit </a>works for a bunch of scenarios because it's a "throw on and go" style solution. Add a fun bag—this one's just big enough for your phone and a credit card—and you'll look so polished.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-headed-to-the-parthenon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Headed to the Parthenon</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I like a few things about this outfit. 1) Sensible walking shoes! 2) A<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> big boat tote</a> for water, snacks, your wallet, and other essentials. 3) Shorts! We love 'em! And, 4) A light and airy top (that you can layer a bra or tube top underneath). Obviously, if the weather is going to be hot, skip the flounce and go with a tank.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taking-a-trip-to-santorini></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taking a Trip to Santorini</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're taking a day trip to an island to catch the social scene, visit landmarks, or just shop and eat (or a healthy mix of all four!), go with something easy-breezy. A bright dress is so chic, without having to put in a ton of effort, and you can accessorize with flip flops and a basket bag. You'll be ready for whatever you're doing that day; The dress feels nice enough for dinner, but casual enough for a sunny hike.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-headed-to-the-beach></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Headed to the Beach</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Break out your most colorful bikini, because you're about to go swimming! All you really need (besides your swim gear) is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cover-up</a> and sandals you can slip on. This one almost looks like PJs, thanks to the stripes, and the material is light enough that you won't be sweltering even in the midday sun.</p><p>Wanna take a pro-level approach to coordinating your look? Try matching your pedicure to your swimsuit for maximum impact.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-going-to-post-beach-dinner-and-drinks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Going to Post-Beach Dinner and Drinks</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obviously, this wouldn't fly at, say, a fancy restaurant, but if you're just throwing something over your suit on the way to drinks and seafood, consider the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> mesh dress</a>. You'll feel a little more covered (emphasis on little), and you'll look so cool. You can skip the chunkier shoes for sandals, obviously.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-visiting-museums-all-day></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Visiting Museums All Day</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getting this out of the way right now: Skip the heels and choose <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fashion sneakers</a> instead. But other than that, this layering outfit is a nice choice when you might be vacillating between temperatures (AC inside, hot outside) and you need to add or take off layers to adapt. Wear longer shorts if your legs are always cold, or tie the sweater around your waist instead of over your shoulders.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-going-to-thessaloniki></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Going to Thessaloniki</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hello, serotonin dressing! If you're unfamiliar, Thessaloniki has a great food scene, active night life, cool sites to visit, and nearby beaches. So you'll want to be dressed for anything and everything—but that doesn't mean you have to be shy about it. Pick a cool pattern in a chic material (this might be a light satin), and then make a day of it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-going-to-a-historical-site></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Going to a Historical Site</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Standard caveat: If you're planning on doing a lot of walking, switch out the flip-flops and wear sneakers (trust us, they are your friend). Shorts and a tee might be an intuitive choice here, but I actually find a loose, opaque <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shirt dress</a> to be a breezy alternative. Pack a bigger bag if you need essentials like sunscreen, and then swap it out for the smaller bag when you're back at the hotel.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taking-a-yacht-trip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taking a Yacht Trip</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For smaller boat trips where you might be zooming around or lounging on the water, you can opt for a skin-baring outfit that leans in on the fun time you're about to have. Crochet might otherwise feel too heavy for a warm-weather excursion, but when it's a light <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>knit crop top</a> and skirt (over a swimsuit), it'll feel more breathable. Even if you don't love color, this is the moment to experiment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-going-to-a-winery></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Going to a Winery</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Headed out to sample some local wine? Throw on this matching crop top and pants set so that you feel classy but fun. This would work with any other food- or drink-related tour (opt for flats, though, if you're walking on grass). The contrasting bag is a nice touch, and it's still big enough to pack a small water bottle if you need it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-headed-to-a-day-of-window-shopping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Headed to a Day of Window Shopping</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For some leisurely, semi-aimless walking (preferably with some ice cream in hand and a few shopping bags in the other), go for something comfortable but still fun. Instead of chunky flats, select sandals or sneakers. And, I cannot stress this enough, remember to apply and re-apply sunscreen, including on your back. No sunburned shoulders here!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-going-on-a-cruise></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Going on a Cruise</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a bigger boat with dedicated stops along the way, you're probably going to need a layered outfit—you might be in the boat, on the deck, on the shore, and everywhere in between. This cropped white jacket is something you can easily take off, the better to show off your patterned top. And the fabric of each piece is protecting you from the elements but not making you feel sweaty.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-staying-out-all-night></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Staying Out All Night</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean...why wouldn't you?? If you're getting ready for a night out, choose a more elevated version of your daytime pieces, like this black crop top and black semi-sheer skirt. Layer on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chunky jewelry</a>, add a cool bag, and choose a chic (but still comfortable) shoe—the better to dance with! Bonus points if this is the last night of your vacation and you're not planning on getting back to the hotel until late.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGYrWWjnby2uMNmoGavlZa%2FbrXNZp6rnZWYsm6ElWpqa2ph</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
