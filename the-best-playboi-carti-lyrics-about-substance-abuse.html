While his music contains various themes and subjects, one recurring theme that can be found in his lyrics is substance abuse. Through his lyrics, Carti provides a candid exploration of drug use, addiction, and the experiences that come with this lifestyle. Let's delve into a few specific examples where this theme is evident in his music.1. "Long Time" - In this track from Carti's debut studio album, "Die Lit," he raps, "In the Hellcat, 'bout to peel out, I got lean now." Here, Carti references the consumption of "lean," a potent concoction made from prescription cough syrup, soda, and sometimes other substances. This lyric addresses the recreational use of substances that many individuals may seek for their intoxicating effects.2. "Poke It Out" - This collaboration with Nicki Minaj includes the lyrics, "Got the Molly and Percocet in my system, yeah, yeah." Carti openly discusses the consumption of both MDMA (commonly known as Molly) and Percocet, a prescription opioid. By mentioning these substances, he portrays a party lifestyle that often involves drug use.3. "Magnolia" - One of Carti's breakout hits, this track includes the lyrics, "In New York, I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock, running from an op, and I shoot at opps." While this lyric mainly references his escape from legal troubles, the mention of "running from an op" may allude to illicit activities related to substance abuse. Furthermore, the rebellious nature of the song's lyrics echoes the risky behaviors that are sometimes associated with substance abuse.4. "Lean 4 Real" - This collaboration with Skepta explicitly references the potency of lean with the lyrics, "I got 98 skills and you only sipping lean." Here, Carti highlights lean as a status symbol, reinforcing the glorification of drug use within certain circles. This type of lyric can contribute to the normalization of substance abuse.5. "FlatBed Freestyle" - In this introspective track, Carti raps, "I'm on the Perc, I can't feel the pain." Here, he openly discusses his use of Percocet to escape pain, both physical and emotional. This lyric reflects the common practice of individuals turning to substances as a coping mechanism, blurring the line between recreational use and self-medication.6. "R.I.P." - Carti's track "R.I.P." captures the fast-paced lifestyle often associated with substance abuse, with lyrics like, "She snort my steez, it go right up her nose." The mention of snorting drugs suggests illicit drug use, like cocaine or other powdered substances. This lyric provides a glimpse into the excessive behavior often linked to drug abuse.It is important to note that while Carti's lyrics may portray substance abuse, they do not necessarily condone or promote it. Artists often use their music as a way to express personal experiences and societal realities. By openly discussing substance abuse, Carti contributes to a broader conversation on the prevalence and complexities of this issue within contemporary culture.It's worth mentioning that substance abuse is a serious matter with potentially harmful consequences. If you or anyone you know is struggling with substance abuse, professional help should be sought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyxuMCymaihXZius8DIaKuhnV2XsrTAjKmjmrGSpLZur8Crq6JlnK6%2Fqq%2FSZpibp6WperTBwayrmqaTmnqirtSsnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
