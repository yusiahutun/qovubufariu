"We are a big family that loves and supports each other. We know a lot of you are asking how to help. Keep the Gattis family in your hearts. If you feel so inclined, we have set up this fund to help Penny, McKenzie and DeLaney as this beautiful family navigates these uncharted waters."</p><p>In the wake of Gattis' death, many country stars have shared memories and tributes to the late Nashville mainstay. <a href=#>Jake Owen</a> and Kendell Marvel were two of the first to share remembrances of their friend. Since then, several more artists, including <a href=#>Jon Randall</a>, <a href=#>Wade Bowen</a>, <a href=#>Chase Bryant</a> and the <a href=#>Brothers Osborne</a>'s John Osborne have all contributed their thoughts.</p><p>"The Nashville community lost a giant. Keith Gattis was the most real person you'd ever meet in your life. An extraordinary talent on every level," Osborne's statement reads in part. "... Was lucky to get [to] know you, Keith. You and your music have made an impact that will outlive us all."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>In Memoriam: Country Stars Who Have Died in 2022</h2><p>May they rest in peace ...</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Lorie Liebig</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2ZqbVus8Ctq6KrXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0jLCYrGWRYsGzrcKtpqtlkZiwqrDEp6to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
