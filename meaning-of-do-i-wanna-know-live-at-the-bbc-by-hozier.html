Through poetic lyrics and a mesmerizing melody, Hozier invites us to examine the depths of our desires and the complexities of human connections.One standout lyric in the song is, "Have you got colour in your cheeks? Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift, the tide that sticks around like somethin' in your teeth?" These lines evoke a sense of unease and vulnerability, highlighting the fear and anticipation that often accompany intense attraction. It suggests that the initial stages of infatuation can be both thrilling and overwhelming, leaving a lingering sense of unease that is difficult to shake.Another lyric that carries significant weight is, "'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow, and I play it on repeat until I fall asleep, spilling drinks on my settee."

'Cause I always do; Maybe I'm too busy bein' yours to fall for somebody new; Now, I've thought it through," serves as the emotional heart of the song. It delves into the complexities of a one-sided love, where the protagonist finds themselves continuously drawn back to the object of their affection, despite knowing the obstacles and uncertainties that lie ahead.
