It plays exactly how I wanted it to play," López shared.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Prime Video</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "But, I do question whether or not if it had been a man and a woman, if we'd still gotten an R rating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MPA scored the gay royal rom-com film (an adaptation of Casey McQuiston's 2019 bestselling novel) with an R rating, labeling it with “some sexual content, partial nudity, and language."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surprised by the stamp, the director admitted he questioned the evaluation of the scoring and whether MPA prefers violence over sexuality. “I think if there had been a scene of violence between them, I could have kept a PG-13 rating, but because they're having sex and they're two men, we got an R," López said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Prime Video</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film stars Taylor Zakhar Perez (as Alex Claremont-Diaz, first son of the U.S.) and Nicholas Galitzine (as Prince Henry) as the leads, who despise each other at first before forming an unlikely romantic connection.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">López, who also co-wrote the script with Ted Malawer, set out to create a&nbsp;film with “no limitations" aimed toward&nbsp;LGBTQ+ audiences. "Contractually, I had the ability to deliver an R rating," he admitted. "There was no limitations on it. I didn't have to do a PG-13 movie. I wanted to make sure the film was going to be as accessible to as many people as possible. I didn't want to limit who the audience would be, but I also didn't want to limit my ability to tell the story in the way that I wanted to tell it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "I essentially decided to hedge my bets, in that I wouldn't step a toe over the line of PG-13 into R when it came to language, when it came to — there's no violence in the story, of course. But I would just do what I felt was right for the story when it came to the sexuality of the film and let the chips fall where they may."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the scoring was dropped, López set forth and amped up the steamy, feel-good scenes. "The funny thing is that once I realized we were going to be rated R, in ADR I went back and put a couple more 'f---s' into the film. I figured why not now?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Red, White & Royal Blue arrives on Prime Video Aug. 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570Z6bZq%2BYnsGmedGosJqkXZe5trGMq2SrmaSeu6h5w6KpnpukpL9uvsSamq2hn6N6eIGVcW1wag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
