Taylor Swift’s highly anticipated new album The Tortured Poets Department is finally available to us to listen to on loop, and as we expected and hoped, Swift mentions boyfriend Travis Kelce. It looks like she may be as chronically online as the rest of us, as she’s addressed THAT resurfaced kiss, marry, kill video from her lover.</strong></p><p>As <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> went public in September, the Swifties put on their detective hats as they dug into the NFL star’s background. Some gems were found, from his <a href=#>hilarious old tweets</a> to an old <a href=#>‘kiss, marry, kill,’ question</a> in which he chose to marry Katy Perry over Taylor. He didn’t get away with that one too lightly as she addresses it in the new song So High School.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1736565874-750x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-addresses-travis-kelce-choosing-to-marry-katy-perry-over-her-in-hilarious-interview>Taylor Swift addresses Travis Kelce ‘choosing to marry’ Katy Perry over her in hilarious interview</h2><p>For those of you who may not be familiar with the video, or may have forgotten what went down exactly, we’ve got you covered. In 2016, the Kansas City Chiefs Tight End was asked to participate in a game of Kiss, Marry, Kill in a light-hearted interview. He was given the options of music stars, Katy Perry, Taylor Swit, and <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p>He chose to unfortunately ‘kill’ Ariana, after exclaiming: “Damn, that’s messed up!” the star responded. “I don’t want to kill any of them.” The 34-year-old then decided to kiss Taylor Swift, and marry Katy Perry. To add more fuel to the fire, the two pop icons <a href=#>had some Bad Blood in the past</a>.</p><p>Now, on to the lyrics of So High School, the star sings: “Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me (Kill me) / It’s just a game, but really (Really) / I’m bettin’ on all three for us two (All three).” Old school Trav with the quiff can’t hide from Tay!</p><p>“Get my car door, isn’t that sweet? (That sweet)/Then pull me to the backsеat,” she continues. Some of the first pap pics we received of the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were the NFL star adorably holding the car door open for Swift. We can’t cope.</p><p>Of course, X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> is going wild at the video reference, as one penned: “Travis, we’re all looking at you!”</p><p>“SHE SAW THAT ONE QUESTION FROM THAT ONE INTERVIEW THIS IS SO CUTE!!” exclaimed another.</p><p>A third wrote: “I’m really like so obsessed with this and I also can’t comprehend that it’s real,” as fans continued to laugh about how the ‘millennial’ in the singer always creeps out.</p><p>“I can’t believe she saw that interview,” writes another. Neither can we!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-not-the-only-mention-travis-gets-on-the-new-album>It’s not the only mention Travis gets on the new album</h2><p>The Traylor stans got what they wanted, as the Bad Blood singer cleverly drops some NFL references in another track on the album, The Alchemy. You can’t beat Swifties, as adorable edits of the song playing over montages are already circulating online.</p><p>“So when I touch down/ Call the amateurs and cut ’em from the team,” the chorus cleverly begins.</p><p>“These blokes warm the benches/We’ve been on a winning streak,” also seem to be referencing the NFL, as well as the lyrics: “Touch down/Call the amateurs and cut ’em from the team/Ditch the clowns, get the crown.”</p><p>“THE ALCHEMY IS A TRAVIS SONG WE WON!!” exclaimed one excited fan.</p><p>“THE ALCHEMY!! SO HAPPY THAT MY TRAVY MADE IT TO THE BIG GAME!!” exclaimed another.</p><p>Brb, going to listen to the album for the millionth time today.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aGcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aqqKaXYq6lsNGeqqydo2LBs63Voqpmo5WhsKa%2FjGtnam5dnru1sdGvoJ6vXay1pr7EZp%2BeZZOdvLSxjKemrWWkpHqurdGrsGaglad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
