It's been a minute, but it's taken me some time to get the courage to post this. I've prayed about this bc I think it matters, and I don't take it lightly that I have a platform, albeit small, to share my heart. On Thanksgiving, I lost the baby. Initially, I felt complete despair. And then I saw the baby. Fully intact. Tiny perfect head and face and arms and legs. This was a perfectly well-thought-out, precious life formed in my belly, and it most certainly went straight to the arms of Jesus. I was so thankful. He gave me peace and joy amid the sadness. Guys, we are SO incredibly and beautifully created…<h2>What happened with LeBron James?</h2><p class=align-left>During a Cleveland Cavaliers game on December 17, 2015, Lebron James barrelled into Ellie Harvey while attempting to collect a loose ball.
