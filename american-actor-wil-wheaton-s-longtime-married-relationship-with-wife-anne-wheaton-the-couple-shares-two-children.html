The lovebirds don't have their own biological child. As of February 2020, the family of four resides in Arcadia, California.</p><p>On 13 February 2020, the actor took his spouse on a hockey date at Staples Center and took a cute snap on his socials.

Most notably, the Burbank, California born star and his partner calls one another "my favorite person".</p><p>Either of the pair shows interest in adventures, animals, sports, horseriding and many more. This might be the reason their relationship lasted longer and never heard of being involved in extramarital affairs, divorce.</p><h2>Wil Wheaton And Wife&nbsp;Anne Wheaton-Happily Married Since 1999</h2><p>Wil Wheaton, 46, is married to his longterm sweetheart, <strong>Anne Wheaton</strong> aka Anne Prince. The couple took their wedding vows on 7th November 1999. They are united as life partners for over two decades now. Nonetheless, it was not a typical Hollywood romance between the pair when it all began!</p><p>During an interview, Anne recalled the time she met her future spouse when he was a struggling actor. Wil has involved in the business work for a long time ever since he learned to make money but he quit it before he turned 20. During the time, Will was struggling to figure out what he wanted to do with his life.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/07/xlet1z4nipqziezt-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wil Wheaton with his lovely wife Anne Wheaton</p><p>Source: Pinterest</p><p>Anne entered Wil's life at just the right moment when she provided all the support he needed to make the right choices and get his career back on track. They first met in 1995 during a New York party at a mutual friend's house. You could say Wil was fascinated by Anne almost instantly.</p><p>The shy actor, 23 at the time, found Anne really cute, but like most guys in his position, he was unable to approach her. Thankfully, his lady friend provided a helping hand and introduced the pair to each other.</p><p>A few days later, the same friend along with her boyfriend invited Wil and Anne on a double date to a movie. Bless that friend! And as they say, the rest is history.</p><p>Relationships never work like magic. It lasts because two people are as much of best friends as they are a couple. Likewise, similar interest&nbsp;provides an added incentive to connect with your partner. This glorious couple seems extremely fond of dogs as they have kept lots of furry friends as their pets.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;the couple does not share any children of their own, but they have two kids from Anne's earlier relationship: <strong>Ryan Wheaton</strong> and <strong>Nolan Wheaton</strong>.</p><p>Both stepsons are dear to the actor, although only one of them, Ryan, was legally adopted by Wil when he asked to do so.</p><p><strong>Another Top Talent</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>"Wedding Alert" Jim Parsons is now officially a Husband of Todd Spiewak.

Where there's true love, nothing stops you from spending the rest of your life with your soulmate!</p><h2>Wil Wheaton And His Well Being</h2><p>Will Wheaton is having a great career and his family life couldn't be more joyous. However, the same can't be said for his health. It was reported Wheaton&nbsp;has a generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, he suffers from chronic depression.</p><p>Wil knows exactly what it's like to go through this illness, so he provides support to related mental health organizations in an attempt to raise awareness of the disease.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/07/images-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Star Trek star Wil Wheaton.</p><p>Source: The Famous People</p><p>This is not everything Wil has trouble with. His other physical problem is persistent sinusitis. Although the illness is as serious as it gets, this does not stop the actor from being a humorous person he generally is. Speaking of sinusitis, he once jokingly said:</p><p>"Clever girl, sinusitis. You had me fooledâ€¦ but you gave yourself away yesterday with the heavy chest, body aches, and the general fatigue, and now I can fight back!"</p><p>The witty Wil does not hold back. Meanwhile, in more seriousness, Wheaton posted a recipe to counter the illness on his website.&nbsp; It's a vegetable soup made of ingredients like tomatoes, carrot, zucchini, potatoes, and yellow squash with celery.</p><p>Wil's friends and his wife&nbsp;were the first to try out this soup. They definitely loved it. Let's hope the recipe is as effective as it is tasty!</p><h2>Wil Wheaton: Quick Facts</h2><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/07/wilwheatonal-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Source: Hollywood Reporter</p><ul><li>Born on 29th July 1972 in Burbank, California.</li><li>His birth sign is Leo.</li><li>His parents are <strong>Richard William Wheaton Jr.</strong> and <strong>Debra Nordean</strong>.</li><li>His debut acting credit was alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Bill Cosby</a>&nbsp;in a Jell-O Pudding Pops commercial.</li><li>Wheaton starred in the hit CBS sitcom "Big Bang Theory" with notorious artists <a href=# rel=noopener>Johnny Galecki</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Kaley Cuoco</a>.</li><li>He played the role of Gordie in the classic film Stand by Me.</li><li>He is renowned for the portrayal of teenager Wesley Crusher in the film Star Trek: The Next Generation.</li><li>Wheaton is an avid pet lover; he owns two Pitbull dogs and a cat.</li><li>He lives with chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder.</li><li>His net worth is estimated to be<strong> $500,000</strong>.</li></ul><p>Be sure to check out <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a> for more updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiucSroJyZnmKupMDOq2SwoZxixKmxwK2mp2WjYrmwusatoKadXaKus77InptmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmrqKelWKur7rEZq6hnZGpvK9506GcZpufqr2tsYysn5qqlah6tcPOZpqhoZyZv6a6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
