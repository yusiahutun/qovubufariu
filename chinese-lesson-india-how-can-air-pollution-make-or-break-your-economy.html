The new regulations came out as the clear winner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pollution went down by 20 to 30 per cent, and industries’ compliance costs went down,” Greenstone said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The current form of regulation is so costly for polluters,” he said. By India moving to a more environmentally conscious market approach, it can “facilitate faster economic growth by reducing the cost to industry”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is an approach that has been widely used in developed countries like the United States, but the Gujarat initiative has shown it is also effective in India, according to Greenstone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a remarkable opportunity sitting there to be grabbed that will allow for faster economic growth and allow for people to live in a cleaner and healthier environment,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Providing information can also develop political will to address air quality, which is what Greenstone hopes to achieve with the AQLI, which uses satellite air quality data to form an index of average global life expectancy loss due to air pollution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Economic growth is great, but it is a limited measure,” he said, adding that “if you are making everyone sick” and reducing the length of their lives, these are real human costs.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Our economies are driven by people powering them.

Long-term issues are surfacing, such as chronic diseases and their economic repercussions, according to Pallavi Pant, head of global health at the Health Effects Institute, an independent research organisation in Boston.</p>“Our economies are driven by people powering them. Continuous exposure to air pollution is really damaging to people’s health. It can manifest in the form of chronic non-communicable diseases, like heart and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">lung diseases</span></a>. The country has to take care of people living with those diseases. Significant medical expenditure can come with it,” she said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[China offers] a clear example of where you decided this is a problem and started putting people, power, resources and science into it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“India is slowly going there and consolidating how policymaking across different sectors, ministries and departments happen so that air pollution starts to be something that is taken into consideration at various levels of decision-making,” Pant said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our path is perhaps a little bit slower, but it’s headed in a similar direction.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She pointed to China’s watershed moment in 2013 when public outcry following frequent and widespread air pollution in the previous autumn and winter seasons in northern China led to a turning point for the country’s air pollution governance.</p>It launched an aggressive nationwide five-year campaign that year to combat <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">air pollution</span></a> and reduce smog by imposing strict controls, including replacing coal-fired power generation with renewable energy and natural gas, and regulating the use of cars in major cities.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A massive air quality monitoring network was also set up to collect a huge quantity of environmental data across the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/63892b84-0df8-4311-a4e2-ca79030bf2ee_a66cec46.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a visible problem – people were getting affected and we needed to deal with it. India has had similar moments which have led to some changes,” Pant said, pointing to India’s 2019 National Clean Air Programme, a five-year action plan to combat air pollution in more than 100 cities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is less ambitious in some ways compared to the programme in China,” Pant said. “But for the first time it started to bring real attention to the issue of air pollution, not just at the national level – but also what the states and cities individually will do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bhargav Krishna, a fellow at Sustainable Futures Collaborative, an independent research organisation based in New Delhi, said health professionals in India are struggling to make the case for health to be a key factor in air pollution policymaking alongside technology availability and finances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The environmental health and policy researcher said while the scientific community has scaled up substantially in the past years, the lack of access to high-quality local health data is hindering public health research.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need accurate data to be able to do effective costing studies which we lack. The research ecosystem really is not up to scratch to be able to support interventions right now,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[In China] new studies are coming out all the time. Part of that is supported by the open availability of health data and air quality data. That remains a big challenge here – the quality and utility of health data in India are still a question mark.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Krishna said the health effects and life lost to air pollution are yet to be seen in economic terms, pointing to a countrywide study by more than 100 researchers in the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution Collaborators published in 2020.</p>The paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Lancet Planet Health found that lost output from premature deaths and morbidity <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">attributable to air pollution</span></a> meant economic losses of a total of US$36.8 billion, or 1.36 per cent of the country’s GDP.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They warned at the time that “the high burden of death and disease due to air pollution and its associated substantial adverse economic impact from loss of output could impede India’s aspiration to be a [US]$5 trillion economy by 2024”. India’s current GDP size is US$4.11 trillion, according to Forbes India.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/21/clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:27</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">All but one of the world’s worst polluted cities are in Asia, 83 of which are in one country</p><p>All but one of the world’s worst polluted cities are in Asia, 83 of which are in one country</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Krishna said generating primary research in India is still expensive, supported mainly by international donors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are talking on the orders of millions of dollars over five to six years to be able to conduct some of this work,” he said. “The Indian ecosystem has been trying to support this by having mutually beneficial arrangements with, say, institutions in the US or Britain [for] collaborative research.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Chinese study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Environmental Economics and Management last year found that air pollution has had an impact on innovation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Severe air pollution can damage human capital, thereby reducing the production of patents in a country or region,” said Wang Chunhua, corresponding author and professor of economics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The team found a corresponding 1.1 per cent decrease in patents and deteriorating air quality in China between 2006 and 2010. However, from 2011-2015, the number of patents increased by 2.2 per cent. China began reducing its PM2.5 concentrations in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s experience shows that “when pollution levels are high, the net benefits of improving air quality may be greater”, making it necessary to use policy tools and enforcement “based on national conditions,” Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While there may be trade-offs, such as costs, to improving air quality, “the positive impact of air quality on innovation, and thus long-term economic growth” should be considered, he added.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/11/16/Clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:43</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">New Delhi deploys water guns to fight ‘hazardous’ smog</p><p>New Delhi deploys water guns to fight ‘hazardous’ smog</p>Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, said as a green energy leader that has maintained a reasonable level of GDP growth, China should work with India to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">combat climate change</span></a>.Zhu said differences between the two major economies, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">especially border disputes</span></a>, “should not hamper their cooperation on important issues that concern human security on both sides”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Air pollution is becoming more acute in India while China has accumulated much experience in the past two decades in cleaning up the environment,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Political leaders must demonstrate their wisdom and willingness to seek cooperation for the benefits of both nations.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At present, he said, China has not been forthcoming about how its air quality transition really happened and what the human cost was – a story that the country needs to tell “more willingly”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If China is able to exchange this information with India, it would be “game-changing”, according to Jain-Punimaya.
