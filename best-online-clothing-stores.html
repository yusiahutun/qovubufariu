Whether you’re looking for something specific, or are seeking a muse or two for your next style makeover, you’ll want to bookmark this story ASAP to refer back to when the inevitable shopping urge comes around.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nordstrom></span> <img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="gold sequin dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o2PFtXt2SWpiyr7n-BWZzJd3S70=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nordstrom-7a7fade32ede4c10850b6b3dd1de5ecf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When in doubt, Nordstrom probably has it. The department store is famous for selling <strong>a little bit of everything</strong> in <strong>every size</strong>, from shoes to shirts to designer goods. Plus, when sales roll around, the discounts are so good that it's nearly impossible to check out with only one or two items in your cart. Nordstrom is also known for its excellent customer service, like free<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}"> virtual styling</a> and curbside pick-ups. If you join the free rewards program, you can also enjoy complimentary alterations in addition to earning points each time you shop. With<strong> beauty and home products</strong> as well, Nordstrom truly is a one-stop shop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free standard shipping | <strong>Best For:</strong> Huge selection | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XLP | <strong>Price Range:</strong> $$–$$$</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saks-fifth-avenue></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saks Fifth Avenue</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saks Off 5th" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J_K6O4fk6NQnhi8-Jm-3XmxRRDU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alexia-admor-one-shoulder-draped-satin-bodysuit-ec79b9ef6d5949f5a590adad2f18535e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Off 5th</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t sleep on this <strong>discounted designer retailer</strong>. Saks Off 5th is the best destination to search for high-end pieces at a fraction of the price. It sells fan favorites like Vince and Jil Sander, and it has amazing shoe and accessory options.

The clothing store prides itself on using <strong>quality materials</strong> — like its<strong> vegan leather </strong>and <strong>breeze Merino wool</strong>, an extra-fine wool and cotton blend — to give shoppers pieces that will stand the test of time. As it starts to get cold, you may want to invest in some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>new puffer jackets</a>. Designed to keep you warm (up to negative 22 degrees), the water-repellent<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes"> Super Puff</a> is a favorite among shoppers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re also crazy about Artizia’s<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes"> TNA</a> collection, which consists of comfy and cool styles, like cargo pants and crewnecks.

The brand not only succeeds at sourcing the<strong> finest materials</strong> — like its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ReCashmere sweaters</a>, a blend of recycled cashmere and wool — but also shares every aspect of its<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> cost breakdown</a> so that you know exactly how much a piece of clothing costs to make. Aside from the <strong>affordable prices</strong>, Everlane committed to quality from day one by using <strong>ethical factories</strong>, high-quality materials, and focusing on <strong>timeless pieces</strong> rather than trends. We believe the durable Italian Leather Day is one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>best ballet flats</a> — full stop. It even sells seamless underwear, which you actually can return after the first try if they don't fit right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping on orders over $75 | <strong>Best For:</strong> Modern basics | <strong>Size:</strong> 2XS–2XL | <strong>Price Range:</strong> $–$$</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-revolve></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve Fashion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OkNICBxpJBBfeMjvrgbHbrI1l1Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SDYS-WK31_V1-7929c7bc64e441928281c0294200ab4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Should your wardrobe need a little...spice, we give you Revolve.
