The meteorologist travels back and forth between both of his residences while working on <a href=#>Today</a>.</p><h2>Inside Al Roker’s Hudson River Valley Home</h2><p>Al and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Deborah Roberts</strong></a>, own their<a href=#> primary residence</a> in New York’s Hudson River Valley. The abode is located “five minutes from the Massachusetts line.”</p><p>“It’s the anti-Hamptons,” the broadcaster told <a href=#>Forbes</a> in May 2020. “You can still go to the grocery store and get a quart of milk for less than $35.”</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple spent a lot of time in the stunning abode with their <a href=#>two younger kids</a>, <strong>Leila</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Roker</strong>. Al is also a dad to his eldest daughter, <strong>Courtney Roker</strong>, whom he adopted during his first marriage with <strong>Alice Bell</strong>. Courtney is a mom to daughter <a href=#>Sky</a>, whom she shares with husband<strong> Wesley Laga</strong>.</p><p>Al has shared so many photos while spending time at home with his kids and his beloved granddaughter. The house boasts a massive living room with cozy yellow sofas and geometric print pillows. The kitchen truly is every chef’s dream, with top of the line appliances and loads of cabinet space. Al loves to cook, so much so that he launched his own holiday cooking podcast, “Cooking Up a Storm.”</p><p>Whenever he wants to get fresh air, Al can step outside onto his back patio and yard. The weathercaster is always sharing videos spending time outdoors or eating dinner on the patio with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/al-rokers-homes-inside-today-hosts-houses.jpg><h2>Everything to Know About Al Roker’s NYC Brownstone</h2><p>Conveniently located in New York City’s Upper East Side, Al and Deborah’s brownstone is their second oasis.
