So what was it all about, and what have fans been saying? Here’s The Idol’s ending explained…&nbsp;</p><p id=eNi3Cdxkee7 data-wc=71>In the finale, it appears that Jocelyn finally sees Tedros for who he is and tries to force him out of her life, with her team arranging an exposé about his criminal past with Vanity Fair. However, when the show goes forward in time by six weeks to Jocelyn’s stadium concert, Tedros - who has lost his club ownership - is given a backstage pass by Jocelyn, who reconciles with him.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: What did you think of The Idol's ending?</figure><p id=evr18aFN_7g data-wc=66>However, while Jocelyn prepares for the show, Tedros notices the brush that Jocelyn previously claimed her mother used to abuse her with, asking her: "Did you say this was the brush your mom beat you with? It’s brand new." In response, Jocelyn smirks while looking at Tedros in the mirror, appearing to confirm that her former story of abuse was made up, leaving Tedros in shock.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6355d82df29-0119theidols01.jpg><p id=e6Azik-Hst2 data-wc=48>In the final moments of the show, Jocelyn welcomes Tedros to the stage while greeting her fans, calling him the love of her life before telling him: "You’re mine forever. Now go stand over there," suggesting that Jocelyn was always the one manipulating Tedros, and not vice versa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dcd9ed254fb7-0217theidols01.jpg><p id=e9voFWMSWQq data-wc=79>Taking to Twitter to <a class=hm-link href=#>discuss the finale</a>, one person wrote: "Wait so Jocelyn was the villain and the entire hairbrush [expletive] was supposed to be a way for her to get control of Tedros and so now she’s back together with him?’ Another person added: "Ends up with an abusive paedophile, makes up abuse allegations about her DEAD MOTHER to gain sympathy points, all so she can write some mid music about daddy choking her? I’ve seen enough &nbsp;#THEIDOL."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dcc9eaa4a0c5-0324theidols01.jpg><p id=e2_a_2dq5I7u data-wc=34>A third person added: "Hold on, i think it was some reverse psychology… Jocelyn now owns Tedros and his people. When she told him to go stand, he was baffled. She’s in control now."&nbsp;</p><p id=ePb90jESpkaw data-wc=27>Sharing their thoughts on the ending, another person wrote: "I swear, the ending with Jocelyn and Tedros was the [expletive] thing I've ever seen in a show."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03423f817bbd-0229theidols01.jpg><p id=e-v4ukyg40Vu data-wc=65>Speaking about the show,<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Lily-Rose, 24, told Vanity Fair</a>: "We know that we’re making something provocative and we are not shying away from that. That’s something I knew I was setting out to do from the beginning. I was never interested in making something puritanical. It’s okay if this show isn’t for everyone and that’s fine — I think all the best art is [polarizing]." &nbsp;</p><p id=eWtxmv2-YdFa data-wc=74>Her co-star Troye Sivan added: <a class=hm-link href=#>"I've never felt more respected</a> and more safe on a set, honestly. And I think the trust that we all built with each other, you and I [Sivan plays Xander], and [creator <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sam Levinson</a>] and I, and Abel and I, that can only make for a really safe-feeling set. So when it comes to the nudity and the risqué nature of the role, that to me was really intentional."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62cdd756abb3-0110theidols01.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG9wYG58tbTEZqCdp5xisq%2BwyKeeZp2opbmitc2em2armZy7qrLInJinm5VitaK10ZuprquYZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
