We have to admit we love stirring them into whatever java drink we ordered. There’s something about the chunky, molasses-colored grains that make it feel fancy. But what is turbinado sugar exactly? Is it better for you than regular ol’ sugar?&nbsp; And when should you use it? We went straight to the pros for answers, and here’s what nutrition experts and chefs had to say about turbinado sugar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is turbinado sugar?</h2><p>Even if you’ve never heard of turbinado sugar by name, you’ve likely encountered brown packets containing it at restaurants and coffee shops. It’s often packaged as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugar in the Raw®</a> Turbinado Cane Sugar. But what is turbinado sugar exactly? “Turbinado sugar is a type of minimally processed cane sugar,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chef Nathaniel Lee</a>, creator of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meal Prepify</a>. “It is made by crushing freshly harvested sugar cane and extracting the juice. This juice is then evaporated and spun in a centrifuge [or turbine] to separate the sugar crystals from the molasses, resulting in turbinado sugar.”&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/turbinadosugar.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Turbinado vs. refined sugar</h2><p>Standard refined sugar also starts with juice extraction and separation, but it is further processed, dried and filtered after these steps. This extra processing results in a difference of texture, color and flavor. “Unlike regular granulated cane sugar, which undergoes significant processing to become highly refined, turbinado retains some of its natural molasses content,” explains food expert <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amanda Biddle</a>, founder and editor of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Striped Spatula</a>. “This gives it a distinctive golden-brown color and a more coarse, textured grain compared to standard white sugar.”</p><p>Sure, turbinado sugar looks and feels different than the refined kind, but they come from the same exact plant. How different could they actually taste? As it turns out, quite different, according to Biddle. “The molasses it retains provides it with subtle caramel-like flavors and a more complex, nuanced sweetness profile,” she says. “For example, when I used it to make peach cobbler last weekend, it added lovely buttery, toasted notes that beautifully accentuated the fruit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The health benefits of turbinado sugar</h2><p>Since turbinado sugar is minimally processed, that makes it healthier than regular refined sugar, right? Not necessarily. “Turbinado sugar is commonly perceived as being healthier than granulated sugar because it undergoes less processing and retains some trace minerals from the molasses,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Gervacio, RND</a>, registered dietitian and nutrition expert at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Living Fit</a>. “However, the nutritional differences between the two are quite minimal. Turbinado sugar does contain small amounts of nutrients like calcium, potassium, and iron that are removed from regular granulated sugar during the refining process, but the amounts are too small to make a significant difference to your health.”</p><p>Gervacio explains further that, at the end of the day, turbinado sugar is basically the same in terms of carbohydrate and calorie content as any other sugar and is best consumed in moderation. “Despite the fact that turbinado sugar has a rustic, natural image, it’s still sugar and offers the same health effect when consumed in excess,” she notes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is turbinado sugar used for?&nbsp;</h2><p>Because their textures and flavors are different, turbinado and refined white sugar aren’t completely interchangeable. White sugar granules are smaller and melt more easily, making white sugar a great option for simply adding sweetness to dishes, with no additional flavor notes or textures. It’s versatile but more one-note.</p><p>Turbinado sugar has coarser, larger grains, and it tastes richer and more buttery than refined sugar, so it tends to shine in more specific scenarios. “Turbinado sugar’s coarser texture and slight molasses flavor make it ideal for sprinkling over baked goods to add a crunchy texture and a touch of caramel sweetness,” says Chef Lee. “It is also a great choice for sweetening hot beverages like coffee or tea, where the subtle molasses flavor can enhance the overall taste.”</p><p>A hot tip from Biddle: “One of my favorite tricks is blending cinnamon and turbinado sugar to coat French toast or churros; the caramel-cinnamon combination is a match made in heaven!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Turbinado sugar recipes</h2><p>Now that you know all about turbinado sugar, put that knowledge to the sweetest use possible!
