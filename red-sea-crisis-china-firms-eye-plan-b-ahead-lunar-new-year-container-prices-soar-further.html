China’s investment in the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The shipping route of the Red Sea is crucial for China’s belt and road projects,” Pan said in an interview with Shanghai-based news website Guancha on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is not just a responsibility to be shouldered by one single country to keep smooth and safe international shipping ways.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a

the Shanghai Shipping Exchange had soared by 25.4 per cent this year as of Friday, having spiked by 77 per cent in December.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has called for a joint effort to restore and ensure the security of the shipping lanes in the Red Sea to avoid disruption to the global supply chain and international trade order.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We will intensify coordination with relevant departments, closely monitor developments and offer support and assistance to firms,” Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said at a press conference on Thursday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the notable rise in demand for containers in China ahead of the Lunar New Year in February, an increase in the use of rail and air “is clearly an option”, said Ulf Bergman, senior economist at the London-headquartered data platform Shipfix.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he also noted that air and rail alternatives are also more relevant for high-value goods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Transport through Russia may be considered high-risk by many importers.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Based on data up to 2022 by Allianz Trade, nearly 75 per cent of trade by volume, excluding the European Union, was transported by sea, while rail accounted for just 3.4 per cent and air 0.4 per cent.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Customers are displaying flexibility by

sufficient” to make up for the volume of goods transported by sea, said Francoise Huang, senior economist for Asia-Pacific at Allianz Trade.</p>“Furthermore, [the] growth in rail freight during the pandemic suggested that the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China-Europe Railway Express</span></a> could potentially be considered a viable option for supply chains, but the war in Ukraine has put the rail lines (which pass through Russia) at risk,” she said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the coronavirus pandemic to the Ukraine war and the recent Red Sea attacks, global trade and supply chains have gone through several rounds of “shocks”, analysts said, and companies are becoming more aware of developing mitigation plans.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

Europe, and direct air freight services into Europe,” said Catherine Chien, head of digital marketing at the Taipei-headquartered Dimerco Express Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Notably, customers are displaying flexibility by accepting longer transit times via the Cape of Good Hope.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Information from Dimerco Express Group showed that diverting shipping around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa would add around 10 to 14 days for transits between Asia and Europe, as well as for the westbound route connecting Asia and the east coast of the United States.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The diversion could also add about 15 to 19 days for the westbound route between Asia and the Mediterranean.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

[highs witnessed] in 2021-22, when supply-chain snarls were at their worst,” said Nick Marro, lead analyst on global trade at The Economist Intelligence Unit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[At] least for the immediate outlook, higher transport costs – as well as delays in getting critical components necessary for production, particularly for Europe-based companies sourcing from Asia – look likely to persist … but really the main factor here will be how the security situation develops in the Red Sea.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hoe Ee Khor, chief economist at the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office, said last week that the Red Sea crisis had not yet led to overall inflation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But if the crisis continues to escalate, it can lead to a bigger disruption to supplies,” he added.</p><p class=postsid
