Nursery beds should be located in an open area near to water source and by adding sufficient organic manures and fertilisers to promote the growth of the seedlings.</p><h2>Types of nursery beds</h2><p class=align-left>There are various types of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nursery beds used by gardeners</a>. Here is a list of the various types of seedbeds in agriculture.</p><h3>1. Flat nursery bed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f039ea09e56acf1.jpg><p class=align-left>It is prepared during spring-summer when there is no risk of rain and in the areas where the soil is light sandy or sandy loam. The beds are flat to the level of the ground.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/674ffb63b43decb5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 types of kale that you'll want to grow in Kenya (pictures)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The fertile<a href=#> land</a> selected for nursery has to be well prepared until the till land and well-rotten FYM at the rate of 10 kilograms per square meter area and is thoroughly mixed in the soil. The field is then divided into small plots comprising beds of uniform size depending on the requirement.</p><p class=align-left>The division is made with the help of a layout rope and measuring tape. Ridges are prepared around each bed. Finally, a control irrigation channel is prepared to connect each bed between two rows of beds.</p><h4>Advantages of a flat nursery bed</h4><ul><li>It provides favourable growth conditions, for example, germination and growth.</li><li>It is possible to grow and maintain a large number of plants per unit area.</li><li>It allows expensive hybrid seeds to be raised more effectively due to better care and management.</li><li>Water movement will be uniform, and drainage of excess water is possible.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/503d7b8f74917dab.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Profitable 3 months crops in Kenya to grow during short rains</span></p></a><h4>Disadvantages of a flat nursery bed</h4><ul><li>Excess irrigation in a flat nursery bed may lead to seedlings rotting and damping-off incidence.</li><li>In a flatbed, water moves from one end to the other, and hence there is the possibility of washing away seeds.</li></ul><h3>2. Raised nursery bed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/674ffb63b43decb5.jpg><p class=align-left>This is a type of nursery mostly used in moist areas. The land is first levelled and free of weeds, stumps, stones or pebbles. The soil of the nursery bed is thoroughly mixed with 5−10 kg per sqm of rotten farmyard manure.</p><p class=align-left>This bed type is prepared about 15cm high from the ground level. The width is kept between metres and 1.5m while the length is between 3m and 5m to enable adequate drainage. Seedbeds can be given side supports of bamboo, twigs, bricks or other locally available materials.</p><h4>Advantages of raised nursery bed</h4><ul><li>By being raised off the ground, raised beds will help keep some of the roaming critters and pets out of your vegetable garden.</li><li>Water movement will be uniform, and drainage of excess water is possible.</li><li>If the soil in your yard is less than ideal for planting, that is to say, rocky, sandy or compacted, having raised beds and bringing in new soil will help solve that problem.</li><li>Since raised beds are above ground level, they require less bending when planting, weeding, or harvesting.</li><li>The germination percentage of seeds is always high. Additionally, operations like weeding and plant protection measures are easy.</li><li>When you have a raised bed, you can simply add landscape fabric under your soil to add additional protection from weeds.</li><li>Raised beds add architectural interest and improve the general flow of your outdoor spaces. Additionally, they can help keep your garden looking neater.</li><li>Water movement will be uniform, and drainage of excess water is possible.</li><li>Raised beds provide a more controlled environment by allowing the putting of wire mesh at the base of your raised beds. This help in keeping unwanted guests from your bed.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/126ffa5d2b7b43ab.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many bags of maize per acre in Kenya? Expected yield per region</span></p></a><h4>Disadvantages of raised nursery bed</h4><ul><li>Raised beds also tend to dry out more quickly. Therefore, you will need to water them more often.</li><li>One of the biggest disadvantages of raised beds is the extra time it takes to plan, build and maintain them.</li><li>Raised beds are more costly to build than planting your veggies directly into the ground. You may also incur additional costs in maintaining your raised beds.</li><li>Buying new soil when preparing a raised bed is costly and time-consuming. For instance, it involves making trips to the store or moving it back and forth from where it’s been delivered onsite.</li></ul><h3>3. Sunken nursery bed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/503d7b8f74917dab.jpg><p class=align-left>This bed type is prepared during winter or in dry and windy areas. The bed has to be kept 10cm−15 cm below the ground level so that when the air blows across the soil surface, the seedlings in the bed are not hit by the cool breeze.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1af0277b58a81378.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many cabbages per acre in Kenya and the cost of farming</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The arrangement also helps protect seedlings from hot winds and evaporation, thus reducing water consumption. The soil of the seedbed has to be sterilised by soil solarisation to avoid contamination by pests and diseases, enhance promoting faster growth of your <a href=#>good crops</a>.</p><h4>Advantages of a sunken bed</h4><ul><li>A sunken bed facilitates the deposition of irrigation water or rainwater for longer.</li><li>It improves the absorption of water.</li><li>Helps keep the soil cooler in summer.</li><li>It protects the seedlings during high wind conditions as they are covered.</li><li>It improves water retention.</li><li>It improved crop uniformity.</li><li>It simplifies irrigation.</li><li>A sunken bed reduces evaporation from the soil.</li><li>This type of bed helps conserve moisture, thus helping in case of water scarcity.</li><li>Reduces nutrient leaching.</li></ul><h4>Disadvantages of a sunken bed</h4><ul><li>Sunken beds can be problematic in climates prone to flooding as they take advantage of sparse rainfall. To avoid flooding, you can dig and create drainage around the beds so they don’t overfill with water and wash away your plants.</li><li>Farmers in cooler climates have no use for sunken beds as the deeper trenches for planting stay cool longer in the spring, hence delaying planting. The added moisture can also stunt or kill plants by drowning their roots.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da6f341556977018.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of mushrooms that are edible in Kenya (with pictures)</span></p></a><h3>Container nursery bed</h3><p class=align-left>A container nursery bed is another type where containers are specifically created to care for species or some <a href=#>species of plants</a> at their seedling stage.</p><h4>Advantages of container nursery bed</h4><ul><li>Containers can easily be moved to adjust to changes in sunlight, shade, temperature, and the gardener’s schedule.</li><li>Most of the time, plants grown in containers have fewer disease problems than plants grown in the soil.</li><li>Containers with thick walls provide better insulation, hence reducing temperature fluctuations.</li><li>Containers may be the only option for urban gardeners with little space and no access to land.</li></ul><h4>Disadvantages of container nursery bed</h4><ul><li>The small amount of soil in containers can dry out rapidly, and the soil temperature can rise and fall to extremes of hot and cold. These changes are harmful to the plant growth.</li><li>Containers must allow excess water drainage; otherwise, waterlogging and damping-off will occur.</li></ul><h2>Steps to undertake to prepare a nursery bed</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efd83ccbb292e668.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tomato farming in Kenya: How much can you earn from an acre?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The following are some of the stepsyou can take while <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">preparing your nursery bed</a> to enhance the growth of seedlings.</p><li>Plough the site for the nursery bed to remove all weeds and stumps left after clearing.</li><li>Excavate the topsoil to about 10 cm deep and heap it somewhere separately.</li><li>Excavate the subsoil and heap it separately for mixing with the nursery media later.</li><li>Remove any stones and roots in both soils, ideally by sieving.</li><li>Return the topsoil into the dug trench of the nursery bed.</li><li>Mix two parts of soil with 1 part of manure or compost and 1 part of sand (if available) to assist in drainage.</li><li>Level the soil in the sunken or raised bed in readiness for planting seeds.</li><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>A nursery bed is a small portion of land used for raising seedlings before transplanting them in the main garden.
