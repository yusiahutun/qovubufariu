It can carry up to 48 projectiles and is capable of firing six rounds per minute with a range of 60km (37 miles).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since its introduction in 1999, the K9 has become one of the South Korean defence industry’s biggest exports, accounting for more than half of howitzer orders worldwide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 1,400 K9 units have so far been or will be exported to eight countries – Turkey, Poland, Finland, Estonia, India, Norway, Australia, and Egypt – six of them Nato member states or US allies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 155mm bore is a Nato-standard artillery shell that is rarely manufactured in Russia or China, with Chinese PLZ-45 howitzers being one of the few exceptions.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/13/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:23</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Xi Jinping says Vietnam is a ‘diplomatic priority’ as Chinese leader seeks closer bilateral ties</p><p>Xi Jinping says Vietnam is a ‘diplomatic priority’ as Chinese leader seeks closer bilateral ties</p>Vietnam is reportedly seeking to buy up to 108 K9 howitzers to replace its obsolete artillery. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Vietnamese artillery</span></a> consists of decades-old weapons systems, including 30 Soviet-era 152.4mm self-propelled howitzers and 360 Chinese Type 63 multiple rocket launchers.It also operates an unknown number of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US-made howitzers</span></a> captured during the Vietnam war, but Nato-standard weapons systems make up a relatively small part of the country’s arsenal.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow for the Vietnam Studies Programme at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Vietnam’s interest in the K9 howitzer is part of a strategy to “diversify” its arms sources beyond Russia, which supplies about 80 per cent of its weaponry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A key factor in Vietnam’s interest is South Korea’s willingness to transfer technology, a significant advantage as Hanoi looks to boost its domestic military production capabilities,” Giang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A potential acquisition of the K9 would also support Vietnam’s ongoing efforts to modernise its military hardware.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said ammunition compatibility would be a key challenge in acquiring the South Korean weapons, since it would require Vietnam’s military to replace all of its 152mm Russian artillery shells.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he said, the K9 would be a “good weapons system” in containing Chinese military power, considering its price and capabilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The ammunition itself will be completely different, so this could mean that [Vietnam’s] large-calibre firearms would gradually move to the Nato standard,” Yang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It means that Vietnam is willing to be equipped with the capabilities to counter China … If you look at previous cases, India has also introduced the K9 to respond against Pakistan, but it also has the implication of countering China.”</p>Vietnam has sought to pursue a balanced strategy amid prolonged US-China rivalry.

Hanoi would never buy weapons from Beijing, and Beijing would be unlikely to sell weapons to Hanoi,” Abuza said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think Vietnam has been interesting … without a doubt, you are going to see a lot more Nato-standard weapons, but it will be in certain sectors and slowly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3d9kHFqaK6ZmsGvrcxmrpqqnZ67qHnNmquoZaOpxq2xjLCcmqifo7%2B6edGunqCdlGLAsMHToWSkp6Karq95x6iuoqyqmr9utM6lm6xlk6HCpr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
