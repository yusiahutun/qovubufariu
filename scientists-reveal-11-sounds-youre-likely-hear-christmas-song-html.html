rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>86 Christmas songs</a>.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is also the ringing of the carillon, an instrument made of&nbsp;at least 23 cast-bronze bells which sound like those in a church.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it's not just the bells that give the music a festive feel, but also the&nbsp;choir, lute, organ, piccolo trumpet and snare drums.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The latter are heard in "Little Drummer Boy",' said&nbsp;Mr Holm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Slightly out of tune pianos as well, such as in the intro to "Home for Christmas" by Maria Mena.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as instruments, the music professor has noted a common chord progression is used a lot in Christmas songs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is the '6-2-5-1' sequence, where each number is the position of the chord's root note on the musical scale of the song.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Holm said: 'This chord progression is commonly used in jazz music, and also in Christmas music.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'A great example of a song that uses this chord progression is "White Christmas" by Irving Berlin, or "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" by Edward Pola and George Wyle.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-991530cb95a5670e

class=mol-para-with-font>The very first Christmas carols are thought to have been hymns written before the year 500, to celebrate the Christian holiday of 'Christ Mass'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Veni redemptur gentium', or 'Come, saviour of the peoples', was written by Ambrose of Milan before his death in the year 397, and celebrates the birth of Jesus.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other well-known festive hymns date back to the Middle Ages, such as 'A Child is Born in Bethlehem' and 'The Boar's Head Carol'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But when the modern Christmas celebration made its entrance in the 19th century with new customs, such as the Christmas tree, carols had a revival and lay people also wrote songs', Mr Holm said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, not all of today's Christmas music sprung from the Christian holiday.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For example, 'Deck The Halls'&nbsp;celebrates the pagan holiday of 'Yule', 'Joy To The World' was originally written anticipating the Second Coming of Jesus, and 'Jingle Bells' was associated with Thanksgiving in the US.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While some Christmas songs are quickly discarded, an elite few have stood the test of time, and work to make this time of year particularly nostalgic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A particularly strong crop emerged in the last part of the 20th century, including 'Merry Christmas Everyone' from Shakin' Stevens and 'Stay Another Day' by East 17.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Holm said: 'They came as a breath of fresh air to the Christmas carol tradition with a new sound in the 80s and 90s.&nbsp;</p><p
