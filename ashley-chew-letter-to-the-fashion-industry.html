Her smile was always accompanied by short face-framing curls or deep polished waves. Headlines across the world ran images of the 26-year old African-American woman. Her name was Breonna Taylor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In early summer 2020, our Instagram newsfeeds were flooded with black squares, captioned with statements such as “we stand with you” or “we love diversity”. Some companies embarrassingly posted nothing at all. The murder of George Floyd reached the fashion industry in the most complex of ways. It seemed trivial for us to post our new haircuts, DIY at-home spa treatments or sponsored content. I cringed at so many tone-deaf companies and even unfollowed their accounts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Performative activism contributes to the problem, and what I mean by that is sharing an Instagram post about the importance of racial equality without diversifying staff, castings and content. It means nothing to talk the talk unless you are prepared to do the work, to act and do better. For two weeks straight I scrolled past black squares. After a while, I didn’t even care about them anymore. I wanted to know what was going to happen within you, the industry, afterwards, how you would go beyond Instagram statements and implement meaningful change.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Performative activism contributes to the problem<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2015, I started the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/blackmodelsmatter/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=#BlackModelsMatter class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">#BlackModelsMatter</a> movement. The hashtag is currently trending at 83,000 on Instagram. At the time, New York Fashion Week catwalks featured less than 10 per cent models of colour. In 2019, there was at least one model of colour in every single runway show and diversity now stands at 43 per cent. Beyond the hashtag, I worked vigorously for the phrase not to become trendy – the fight for better Black representation in fashion is not a trend. I’ve spoken for The New York Times, Columbia University, The Indianapolis Museum of Art, magazine panels and even at an event in Lagos, Nigeria. I served on The Model Alliance Advisory Board and have sat in with The Humans Of Fashion Foundation. I have poked microphones directly in designers’ faces backstage at Fashion Week asking what more can be done.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Performative activism does not go to these lengths. Performative activism posts a graphic online, and then carries on with Zoom meetings while their African-American colleagues are on the receiving end, heartbroken. Performative activism says, “we value diversity”, yet allows racism to manifest itself within meetings, editing, casting rooms, and on set. Allyship is not confined to a black square on social media. Allyship requires honesty, responsibility and accountability.</p><img alt="ashley chew" title="Ashley Chew" width=2953 height=4429 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ashley-chew1-1603110418.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrew Toth</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a working African-American model and visual artist, I have been well-equipped to deal with racism; I have a choice about who I choose to champion. During New York Fashion Week, I don’t attend shows that do not cast Black models. On social media, I do not follow brands that don’t reflect society. Your attention is your highest currency. Brands like Telfar, Fenty, Aerie, Pacifica, Christian Siriano, and Pyer Moss have my full support. These brands undoubtedly have shown diversity in race, age, gender and body positivity long before Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement. If every company took similar initiatives, some rooms in the industry wouldn’t be so unbearable, unwelcoming, and uncomfortable.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>What good is using Black culture if Black people aren’t allowed in the room? <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I still have hope for the future of fashion, but there must be accountability. As a society we are so pressured into making the next thing, being the next big thing or simply buying more things. It is essential for us to care about the people that contribute to those exact things. “Never let them convince you that broken glass or property is violence,” said <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CA2_a_YluIQ/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marc Jacobs in response to the damage done to his Soho location" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Marc Jacobs in response to the damage done to his Soho location</a> in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests. “Property can be replaced, human lives cannot.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I am relieved that activism is not taboo anymore. Activism can happen at any time, anywhere by anyone. Five years ago, I was a liability. People in this industry were afraid to exercise their freedom of speech in fear of being blacklisted or even fired. But what you, the fashion world, needs to know is this: caring about people shouldn’t be a liability. What good is using Black culture if Black people aren’t allowed in the room? There is no one better to tell Black stories than Black people. Black editors matter, Black designers matter, Black directors matter, Black models matter, Black creatives matter, Black lives matter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like this article? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our new newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Sign up to our new newsletter</u></a> to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-href="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">SIGN UP</a></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudICTamlxcWFkrrS0y56wZpuYmsRuuMStq56qXam8bsDHnmSfmaOdtrC6jKKlna2jqb%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
