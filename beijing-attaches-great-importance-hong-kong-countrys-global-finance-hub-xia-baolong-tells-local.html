Hong Kong will definitely develop better and better in the new stage, going from order to prosperity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xia also said that Hong Kong’s remarkable achievements in economic development after its return to the country were gained with the efforts of various chambers of commerce and companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong is a paradise for business executives to start their own businesses and a place to achieve their dreams,” the statement cited Xia as saying, referring to the city’s advantages such as its business environment, rule of law, simple tax system and its high degree of internationalisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said Xia “attached great importance to Hong Kong’s status as an international city and listened to the opinions of local and foreign chambers of commerce”, who later said they asked for easier access to the Greater Bay Area, Beijing’s plan to link 11 southern cities into an economic powerhouse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The top Beijing official is making a weeklong fact-finding trip, which Lee said centred around economic development and district governance. It is Xia’s second visit in less than a year and his first since the city’s electoral system was overhauled to allow only “patriots” to run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The one country, two systems principle was one of 10 things that made Hong Kong different from mainland Chinese cities, Xia told the representatives, according to one attendee who asked not to be identified. Other distinguishing features were the city’s legal system, stock market, number of international banks and proficiency in English, the official was quoted as saying.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘More mainland Chinese cities may join Hong Kong solo traveller scheme’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The attendee cited Xia as saying that the one country, two systems principle would remain as “a permanent structure” and the country’s high-quality development would continue to support Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Concerns raised during the meeting were mainly about the city’s economy, which has been heavily battered by the three years of Covid-19,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Representatives of 15 business lobbies spoke at the meeting, according to the attendee. Seven were from local chambers, four from Southeast Asian ones, three from groups belonging to European countries and one from a body with a Middle Eastern country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said none raised concerns about the domestic national security legislation required under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. No representatives of the British or US chambers of commerce spoke at the meeting, the insider added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The proposed legislation, which will sit alongside the national security law that Beijing imposed in 2020, targets five new types of offences: treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets and espionage, sabotage endangering national security, and external interference. Its 30-day consultation exercise ends on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Betty Yuen So Siu-mai, chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, called the meeting a boost of confidence for investors. She added that the Beijing official was “obviously very caring about the situation about Hong Kong”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xia “emphasised that Hong Kong’s investment and property were protected,” she said. “He also called on the business community to invest with confidence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He reiterated the comment from President Xi [Jinping] about the one country, two systems being a very good policy that is working very well for Hong Kong, and there is no reason to make any changes in the long term.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But she stressed Hong Kong needed to reposition itself or risk becoming less competitive than neighbouring cities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chambers and businesses in the Greater Bay Area feel that the region has huge potential for Hong Kong businesses,” she said, adding attendees proposed additional measures to make it easier for local companies and residents to do business in the bay area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wilhelm Brauner, chairman of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, said after the meeting he had conveyed the hope of his members for new ways allowing easier movement in and out of the bay area. He added that they would pay attention to the situation after the new national security law came into force.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What ‘facts’ for Beijing’s top man on Hong Kong affairs on his fact-finding mission?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With the rule of law and traditions of Hong Kong, I have confidence it will be handled accordingly,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malaysian Chamber of Commerce chairman Gan Khai Choon also expressed confidence in the proposed legislation after the meeting, noting how the business of his members was badly affected during the anti-government protests in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We realise that after the recent announcement [regarding Article 23], our business and our friends from Malaysia and Southeast Asia are very confident to return to Hong Kong as tourists, as businessmen and continue to stay here,” he said, adding he looked forward to seeing greater collaboration with Hong Kong and the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xia also had another 90-minute closed-door meeting with about 30 local patriotic groups and associations, including the Hong Kong Coalition and Heung Yee Kuk rural body, where the local economy and people’s livelihood were discussed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xia asked the groups to remain united in support of city leader Lee, according to Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak Mei-kuen, who took part in the meeting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A work dinner was also held between Xia and company representatives to discuss attracting strategic enterprises to the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier in the day, Xia met local regulators, with Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui Ching-yu saying Beijing attached “great importance” to Hong Kong’s role as the country’s international financial hub.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Top Beijing official calls on Hong Kong to cement status as international city</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Director Xia highly values Hong Kong’s status as the country’s financial centre and its past contributions to national development,” Hui told journalists after the meeting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We should devote our minds to developing the financial market, boosting the Stock Connect [with mainland China] and expanding the offshore renminbi market.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The country introduced a mutual market access scheme in 2014 that allowed investors from Hong Kong to trade in Shanghai’s domestic A-share and vice versa. The agreement was expanded to Shenzhen two years later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hui said Xia also used the morning meeting to hear views from attendees on how the finance industry could continue to thrive in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue Wai-man, Securities and Futures Commission chief executive Julia Leung Fung-yee and Financial Services Development Council chairman Laurence Li Lu-jen were also among those who attended.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Tuesday, the sixth day of his trip, Xia will pay a visit to the West Kowloon Cultural District and the Hong Kong Palace Museum, before talking with local people and later a range of economic experts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Beijing official will leave the city on Wednesday, the same day Chan unveils his budget.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Connor Mycroft</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZop6ikmam2pL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW5qa2lmZK%2BmtcmipaBlkanBoq%2FHnqpmn6KarrV5yKanqKqklruksYyhpqefXaC8r7OMnKaupqSnxrR5xqWmm5mcYrOqusCnmp5lmKqvbsTImmSbmZ%2BhvK%2BzjK2cpaSjYrmwr8Cl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
