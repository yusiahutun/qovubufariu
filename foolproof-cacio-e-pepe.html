Deb, you wrote about it years ago, <a href=#>in 2011</a>. But the recipe always bothered me, and the reason is written out right in it: authentic cacio e pepe contains only three sauce ingredients: pecorino romano (this is the cacio, the cheese), black pepper (this is the pepe, ground to your desired texture, often toasted first if you’re going for extra flavor), and pasta, plus splashes of the pasta’s hot starchy cooking water to form a sauce. It doesn’t contain oil, butter, cream, flour, cornstarch or any other binders. The trouble begins when you try to merge/coalesce/magic together water and cheese into an emulsified, creamy sauce. Ever tried to mix oil and water? In my kitchen, it goes about as well as you might imagine.</p><p><a title="all you need" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1865/29512108217_5c77dd3fbb_z.jpg alt="all you need" width=640 height=426 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="with a fp, you can also grind the cheese" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1891/43732600784_79ec411174_z.jpg alt="with a fp, you can also grind the cheese" width=640 height=426 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="a paste of cold water, cheese, and pepper" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1852/29512107887_3d153af7de_z.jpg alt="a paste of cold water, cheese, and pepper" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="collect your pasta water before you drain your pasta" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1883/43732600484_e2ee174995_z.jpg alt="collect your pasta water before you drain your pasta" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Frustrated in 2011, I added a little cream and butter* to make it work. But I never “finished” the recipe in my mind. Since then, I have tried — this is barely an understatement — every single 3-ingredient technique on the internet and in cookbooks I could track down, I have watched videos completely in Italian to try to glom how they do it, walked into the kitchen, repeated their exact steps, and failed every time. I try about 6 times a year. It’s been 7 years. I never, ever succeed in magic-ing pasta water and cheese into a smooth sauce. The cheese melts before it glues itself to the noodles, cementing itself instead to the pot, the bowl, the tongs, the stuff of dishwashing dread. I imagine this sounds familiar to others.</p><p><a title="piping hot pasta" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1877/29512107357_042309260d_z.jpg alt="piping hot pasta" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="add sauce base to taste" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1851/43732600054_8d1f974c4f_z.jpg alt="add sauce base to taste" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>When someone emailed me (hi, Annie!) earlier this summer and told me about Flavio de Maio’s (of the restaurant <a href=#>Flavio Velavevodetto</a> in Rome) method as shared by <a href=#>tour guide and Roman cooking expert</a> <a href=#>Elizabeth Minchilli</a> on her site, I was fresh off my latest cacio flop and thanked her, but expressed my doubt that this would be This One.

No heat touches the sauce until it hits the piping hot pasta, so it melts only onto the noodles. At this point, you use spoonfuls of cooking water as needed to loosen it to a thick but lightly creamy consistency. And it works every time, which will I bet will a lot more often after today.<p>Check out <a href=#>Elizabeth Minchilli’s site</a> for a video of Flavio making it himself with an immersion blender.</p><p>The traditional pasta used for cacio e pepe is tonnarelli, sometimes sold as spaghetti alla chittara, a squared-off, slightly thicker spaghetti, but you use what you can get. I’m using standard thickness spaghetti here. The traditional cheese used for cacio e pepe is pecorino romano, a sharp, salty aged sheep’s milk cheese. If you can only get parmesan, it works too, but you’ll probably need to add salt to the sauce. While the recipe below works as written, you’ll probably want to make adjustments to taste, and to the intensity, age, and saltiness of your cheese.</p><p>How much is “a lot” of freshly ground black pepper? It’s impossible to measure — too low in grams to register steadily on a scale, too varied in coarseness to measure in consistent measuring spoons, plus peppercorns vary in intensity, and your preference may not be someone else’s. Taste the cheese-pepper mixture. The pepper should be prominent and give it a sparkly kick. If you want more, add more. Remember that this sauce base will stretch over a lot of pasta, so if it tastes too intense, that’s probably correct. For what it’s worth, I counted 46 peppermill grinds on one batch, but I keep mine pretty tight/at a fine grind.</p><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>8 ounces dried spaghetti or tonnarelli</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>4 ounces aged pecorino romano, finely grated</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>A lot of freshly ground black pepper</li></ul>Bring a pot of well-salted water to boil. Cook pasta to one minute shy of package instructions and taste for your desired doneness, cooking a minute longer if needed. We are not cooking the pasta and sauce further together on the stove, so the bite it has now is about what your final dish will.<p>While it’s cooking, combine all the pecorino (except a spoonful for garnish) and lots of freshly ground black pepper in a bowl. Add 1 tablespoon cold water and use an immersion blender to work it into a paste, adding additional cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, only as needed. You want to form the mixture into a paste about the thickness of cream cheese or frosting. I use about 4 to 5 tablespoons total for this amount. Blend more than you think is needed; you want this paste as smooth as you can get it. You can do this same process in a food processor, even grinding the cheese in it instead of grating it first but it will require longer processing to get the rubble-like cheese smooth.</p><p>Before the pasta is done, scoop out a cup of hot cooking water and set it aside. Drain the pasta very quickly in a colander (no need to shake every drop of water off) and immediately drop it, piping hot, into a large bowl. Add 3/4 of cheese-pepper paste in dollops and toss to combine. It’s going to be too thick to form a sauce but once it has begun to coat the noodles, pour in one small ladleful of pasta water and toss, toss, toss (a lot of movement helps here) to loosen the paste into a lightly creamy consistency that evenly coats the spaghetti strands. Taste and add more of the cheese-pepper paste to taste, or use it all. Add more pasta water as needed only to loosen.</p><p>Finish with reserved pecorino and a few grinds of black pepper. Eat <i>immediately</i>.</p><br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-36949 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-36949 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
