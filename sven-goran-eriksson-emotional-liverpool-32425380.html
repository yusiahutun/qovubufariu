"When I was a manager I always dreamed about [managing] Liverpool but it never happened," he said.</p><p>"It was close once," added Eriksson. "There were some discussions once, many years ago. It's like a dream. I could never have dreamed of it. It must be the best atmosphere in the world and part of that is the song when the players walk out - You'll Never Walk Alone.</p><p>"When they asked, I thought it was a joke. Of course I would come to a Legends match.
