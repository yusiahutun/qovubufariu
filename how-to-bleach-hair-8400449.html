It could be a desire to overhaul their appearance, a way to camouflage gray, or something they’ve been doing for years and can’t quit. When it comes to how to bleach hair, there are two ways to do it: professionally at a salon or at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With beauty prices skyrocketing, especially highlights and high-lift color, the desire to bleach and color your hair at home may sound appealing. But a lot more goes into a DIY bleach job than you may think. Ahead, we break down everything you need to know about how to bleach hair at home, how to do it sans damage, should you go that route, and when it’s time to leave the process to the experts.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sharon Dorram</a> is a celebrity colorist and owner of Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger Salon in New York City.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Cassandra Olivia</a> is a hairstylist and colorist in New Castle County, Delaware.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Joseph Randall,</a> hairstylist and owner of Color Haus in Charlotte, North Carolina.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-hair-bleaching></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Hair Bleaching?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair bleaching is exactly what it sounds like using hair bleach (not household bleach) to lighten the hair's color. While bleaching your hair may sound fun and simple, it's anything but that. Dorram says people usually choose to bleach their hair at home because of budget. "Some people do not prioritize hair color in their beauty budget. Hair color is the least invasive way to look your best." The other reason for at-home bleaching is the convenience factor. "Everyone is busy. If you are handy, you may be able to get away with doing your color."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Going from black to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bleach blonde</a> in the privacy of your bathroom isn't realistic. Olivia says usually, at most, you can lighten hair one to two shades lighter than its current color. "Of course, this varies based on your natural hair color. Blondes and light brunettes can succeed more with at-home bleach than people with dark or black hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-at-home-bleaching-safe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is At-Home Bleaching Safe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to how to bleach the hair, it's a whole other ballgame from a DIY single-process color. Dorram doesn't recommend lightening or bleaching your hair at home and, instead, leaving it to the pros. "There can be hazards to doing it yourself and lots of damage." Furthermore, she doesn't advise anyone with already colored hair to bleach at home, which can impair the hair's health, causing frizz, breakage, dullness, and hard-to-manage hair. "I also don't suggest anyone with very dark or curly hair do it because the result will always look unnatural. Dark hair can look brassy, reddish, or orange, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curly hair</a> can make it difficult to create natural-looking highlights instead of stripes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Randall says the only upside to DIY bleaching is maybe the cost. "But on the other hand, you get what you pay for. You have to understand the chemical science behind bleaching and the processes, and then you may be able to achieve a good result at home."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Olivia explains, the health of your hair plays a vital role in bleaching. Hair fraught with split or snarled ends is dehydrated, and chemicals and excessive exposure to bleach can worsen things. "Healthier hair always fares better during the bleaching process because it can withstand the damage that hair color causes," she says. "I've seen clients come into the salon with chunks of hair that split off and break because the hair was so weak from at-home coloring."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-the-right-at-home-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose the Right At-Home Products</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bleaching your hair at home involves mixing a lightening agent, either liquid or powder, with a developer, such as hydrogen peroxide, to open the cuticle and pull pigment out of the hair. The ingredients are the biggest difference between bleach and the corresponding color products used at home versus by your colorist. Randall explains that professional-grade hair-lightening products have ingredients of higher potency. "Typically, at-home kits do not offer the same level of power."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Investing in a hair bleaching kit is better than trying to piece together what you need. "The kits available are very basic," Dorram says. "They usually contain powder and a liquid bleach, which makes for easy application. Low-volume peroxide non-ammonia bleach products from professional companies like L'Oréal and Clairol are best." Some even contain toner. There are also bleach and color kits, like IGK's new Color Bright, to create a two-tone look, pop your money pieces, or dip-dye hair, and lightening kits from Madison Reed with everything needed to lighten hair at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-bleach-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Bleach Hair</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Take Safety Precautions</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, please make sure you're working in a well-ventilated room and wearing a mask. "It's a good idea to invest in a professional coloring cape to keep your clothes clean," Olivia suggests. "Wear clothes that you don't care about in case they get bleached in the process. And prep your space by putting down old towels on the sink and floor and remove anything you wouldn't want to get damaged by the chemicals."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. Wash and Dry Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, you'll want to wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and use a conditioning treatment before bleaching it. Dorram recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Virtue's Purifying Shampoo</a> ($32) and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Restorative Treatment Mask</a> ($34). Then, dry the hair completely without using any styling or leave-in products, including oils, which can interfere with the color's development.</p><p>There's no need to wash your hair before bleaching it. In fact, the dirtier the hair, the better! Shampooing the hair before bleaching it can strip away its natural oils, which may dry it and the scalp. Plus, when the scalp has ample natural oil, bleach is less likely to cause micro tears and irritation.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Strip Test</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before placing bleach all over the hair, Dorram says to strip-test a small piece of hair below the ear. "Leave the bleach on for the time instructed, and make sure you like the results." She recommends doing the same with toner. "Leave it on for two to three minutes and dry the strand test before using it all over the head." Once you are happy with the color and degree of lightness on the test strands, it's time to apply the bleach all over while looking into a mirror.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. Protect the Hairline</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apply coconut oil or a scalp color protector to the hairline, which can maintain the scalp's pH levels. Bleach is an alkaline product that can irritate the scalp (especially if yours is sensitive), so protecting it can reduce the risk of irritations and even post-coloring itching.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. Mix the Bleach</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mix the bleach with the liquid developer in a bowl to create a single solution. Adding developer to bleach forces open the hair's cuticle to lift away the existing color and allow it to lighten.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6. Section the Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Separate the hair into four large sections (two in the back and two on top) with a comb or the handle of a color brush. Each section should be clean and well delineated from the next so you can easily apply the bleach without overlapping it onto the hair.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>7. Apply Bleach</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Use a hair dye brush to apply the mixed bleach to the hair. Start by concentrating on the back of the head and areas where the hair is darkest while avoiding direct application to the scalp (keep the bleach at least one inch away). Make sure to apply the bleach from the mid-shaft down until the entire section is well covered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the back of the head is complete, apply the bleach to the top of the head and then the front sections of hair. Dorram recommends taking thin strips of hair that frame the face and separating them away from the rest of the hair with a piece of cotton, Saran wrap, or foil. "Be careful that the hair you are lightening doesn't touch the rest of your hair."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>8. Process and Rinse</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Set a timer for 30 to 45 minutes and let the bleach process. The hair should lift to a banana-yellow color, not orange or red (unless that's the look you are going for). Then, rinse out the bleach using water and a wet towel. You can also spray down the hair with a water bottle to prevent the bleach from lifting further. Repeat until you reach the desired shade of lift.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>9. Shampoo and Condition</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shampoo the hair with a gentle shampoo until the bleach runs out thoroughly. You'll want to make sure that all of the bleach is out of the hair. Otherwise, if the lightener or developer lingers in the hair, it can affect its health and moisture levels.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>10. Apply Toner</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apply toner to the hair to achieve the right tone for your hair, but only use it if the bleach causes the hair to appear too light, ashy, or brassy or if you want to add cool or warm tones to your hair. Work the toner all over the head and leave it on for 10 minutes. Then, shampoo it out.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aftercare-and-maintenance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aftercare and Maintenance</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end, if you're unhappy with the results, make an appointment with your colorist. Trying to cover up a bleach job gone awry isn't as simple as slapping on some temporary or box hair color. "No matter what, don't try to fix it at home," Olivia says. "It's a recipe for fried, damaged hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lightening the hair to the desired shade of blonde is the easy part. Keeping it that way is more tedious. There's plenty to do to preserve your hair's health and bright, sharp color. Olivia says after coloring the hair, keep it out of the sun and wash it less frequently. "You can use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>purple shampoo </a>to counteract yellow tones that may develop."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anytime the hair is lightened, it loses moisture, which needs to be replenished. "The best way to rehydrate the hair is with ingredients and products that boost the hair's health," Olivia says. "Cannabinoids, specifically CBD, CBC, and CBG, provide intense moisture to hair and help restore the natural balance of oils on the scalp and within the hair to help repair it. I recommend<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> LEAF + FLOWER CBD Instant Damage Correction Shampoo and Conditioner</a>. They both work to address the needs of compromised hair using a highly active cannabinoid blend of CBD, CBC, and CBG to leave hair feeling soft and manageable while adding shine and reducing frizz." Conditioning masks are also important to use weekly. "Some of my favorites are from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Virtue</a>,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow> K18</a>, and<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow> Shu Uemura</a>," Dorram says. "They will keep your hair shiny, bouncy, and healthy!"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-c9ec18c8-4ac3-4589-b883-694b8b67fe81></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do you bleach your hair wet or dry?</span></p><p>You should only bleach dry hair.

So if the hair is more yellow-orange or 'brassy,' you will need a blue shampoo to provide any toning of the hair."<br></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYq%2BtscCcn2agkZ6%2FboSTaWdtbGk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
