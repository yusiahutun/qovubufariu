It used to be so quiet on my road,” Wahlberg told Daily Mail. “Then David moves in with his family. Suddenly we’ve got paparazzi hanging out day and night. Now they’ll follow any car that drives down the road. I take strong exception to that kind of thing. When I take my kids to the park I don’t want strangers sticking their lenses into our faces.”</p><p>He continued, “Where I come from it’s not considered wise to follow people around like that unless you’re looking for serious trouble. When that happens I start thinking, ‘Either I’m going to get that guy or he’s going to get me.’”</p><p>Wahlberg later retracted his comments as he later told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Sun</a>: “He (Beckham) wanted me to email him about something – I don’t know if it was a film. I had said something, half joking, because his house is at the bottom of our hill and a lot of people hang around the area. So I said something like, “I don’t like him being here because of that.”</p><p>“I met him and some of his sons and he seems like a nice guy… I wanted to make sure he hadn’t taken that (remark) personally.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>2019: Mark Wahlberg buys stakes in F45 training</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mark-wahlber-f45.jpg><p>In 2019, Mark Wahlberg teamed up with venture capital company FOD Capital to buy a stake in F45.
