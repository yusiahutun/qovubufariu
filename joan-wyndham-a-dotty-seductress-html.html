One never knew what one was going to lose first - one's life or one's virginity."</p><p>Srcoll down for more...<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/04_01/wyndhamDM1604_468x615.jpg height=615 width=468 alt=wyndham style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>As her many admirers know, Joan was deflowered in a Chelsea artist's studio during a wartime air raid. She described the experience and many racy memories like it in four autobiographical books, including the popular Love Lessons.</p><p>She was still enjoying a louche life until well into old age, giving her renowned Bohemian parties until shortly before her death earlier this month at the age of 85.</p><p>In the Sixties and Seventies, rent boys, artists, politicians (including Michael Foot), actors such as Ian McKellen, transsexual April Ashley and the Profumo case call-girl Christine Keeler attended her gatherings.</p><p>But it is for her wry way of recording her wartime experiences that Joan Wyndham will be remembered.</p><p>Dylan Thomas pinched her bottom in a Soho pub and then "smothered her with wet beery kisses" in a London taxi. So ardent and insufferable did the drunken Welsh poet become that she had to bolt her bedroom door as he repeatedly tried to break it down.</p><p>Left-wing intellectual Philip Toynbee was "sick on her sofa", while the 17th Lord Lovat (the "so unbearably attractive" hero of the Dieppe beaches) became her lover in the Ritz Hotel after a dinner of partridge.</p><p>Joan's confessions conjure up the mood of an era. She recalled her first seduction: "I lay on the sofa with Rupert and got into some rather peculiar positions, howling: 'I wanna seduce you, I wanna seduce you!'</p><p>"At that interesting moment, the sirens blew off. I jumped up to check the black-out, pulling my blouse on and looking for my shoes. 'Gosh!' I said, 'Mummy thought I'd be back by ten!'</p><p>"Rupert didn't answer. He was lying on the bed, face downwards making strange groaning noises. As I was walking home, I heard bombs in the distance and flares."</p><p>Joan kissed and told all with charm and wide-eyed innocence, as well as a cruel accuracy - but solely to her diary at first. It was only later, when she was in her 60s and her daughter found the volumes in the family attic, that she was persuaded to publish them.</p><p>Joan was not the only eccentric in her family. Her father, Dick, came from a long line of aristocrats with sexual tastes that marked them as quite unsuitable for matrimony - one uncle was found dead in a Paris bordello.</p><p>Her mother, Iris, whose forbears were diplomats, was brought up in Romania and spent her teens in Paris where she would walk around with a blue fox fur and a Persian kitten.</p><p>Joan was born in 1921 in the Wyndhams' famous country house, Clouds, in Wiltshire.</p><p>The family moved in racy circles, which included Oscar Wilde and the poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt, known as "society's tom cat" because he bedded everyone he fancied.</p><p>The house had 40 bedrooms and the kitchen was so far from the dining room that the food had to be sent in on a little internal railway.</p><p>By the time Joan was two, her parents' marriage was over. Her father, whom she later learned was known everywhere as "one of Europe's great flagellists" - indulging in sado-masochistic behaviour - had been discovered behind the family Christmas tree in a heated clinch with the Marchioness of Queensberry.</p><p>There was a bitter divorce and Iris moved to London with the young Joan and set up home with a lesbian painter. She became a devout Roman Catholic and sent her daughter to convent boarding school aged seven.</p><p>By the time she was a teenager, Joan was already showing a restless spirit and witty eye.</p><p>She succumbed to a series of crushes on her schoolfriends, which were not returned. "I can't blame them, when I remember how I looked," she confessed to her diary - "long greasy plaits, goggles and a brace on my front teeth. I had a funny way of talking, with my head bent to one side. Worst of all, I was brainy and a swot."</p><p>As soon as she left school Joan transferred her affections to the most famous stage actors of the day.</p><p>"It's all very well being cracked on other girls," she confessed to her diary - but men was what interested her from now on.</p><p>After seeing John Gielgud in Hamlet, she confessed she often "followed him home so that I could kiss his doorknob".</p><p>Soon she was admiring the "totally gorgeous" young Laurence Olivier and the homosexual dancer Robert Helpmann - "gosh, what a bottom!"</p><p>No one's idiosyncrasies were spared. One critic dubbed her 'a latterday Samuel Pepys in camiknickers'.</p><p>For the time being, acting was all that interested her. She joined RADA in 1937 only to have to forgo a theatre career because of the onset of war. When the school shut because of the bombings she enrolled to become a nurse.</p><p>But nothing could deter her determination to find out what love was all about.</p><p>The man she first marked out for her initiation was an elderly German refugee who sculpted in an artist's studio close to her Chelsea home.</p><p>"How can I describe Gerhardt? If I was feeling</p><p>romantic I should say 'Pan', if realistic then the most depraved long-haired Bohemian in a blue shirt and corduroy pants that ever drank cheap red wine."</p><p>Though her mother disapproved, Joan pursued the German and was encouraged by him to take art lessons at Chelsea Polytechnic, where she was taught by sculptor Henry Moore.</p><p>There was a brief, reluctant hiatus from Chelsea life while she was drafted in 1941 to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in Lancashire. But she was soon posted to Fighter Command Headquarters at Stanmore, from where she made regular trips back to the pubs of Fitzrovia.</p><p>Typically, she spent her first leave with a bearded Czech artist who picked her up on the street and took her back to a former brothel in Chelsea.</p><p>During another drunken fling she found a man standing at the end of her bed wearing a black macintosh - and nothing else. He told her he was a newspaper reporter. Joan duly succumbed.</p><p>Her brief wartime flings included one with a married Hungarian called Zoltan and a handsome Norwegian naval first lieutenant from whom she caught fleas.</p><p>She also went for a spin with the youngest squadron leader in the Polish Air Force and had her bottom pinched at 3,000ft.</p><p>After such experiences, Joan was assessed by her superiors as "a very peculiar type of officer, not amenable to discipline and a bad example to other ranks".</p><p>Nevertheless, she was promoted to flight officer and a dreary posting near Nottingham. She</p><p>lamented of the "ugly and squalid" barracks. "But</p><p>it has one great advantage: a mixed mess."</p><p>After the war, Joan married docker's son Maurice Rowdon. They had a daughter and they went to Baghdad, where Maurice had landed a teaching job.</p><p>But soon, the marriage was over and her father, who had been covering the Arab-Israeli war for a newspaper, had been shot dead. Joan came into a legacy, enabling her to buy a cottage in Kent.</p><p>She soon embarked on an affair with her exotic Russian poet lodger, Shura Shivarg, and the two had another daughter.</p><p>After a spell as a horoscope writer, a publisher's reader and the owner of Oxford's first espresso bar, she married Shura and returned to Chelsea.</p><p>Yet, married life was never uneventful. She and Shura travelled from Russia to the U.S. meeting celebrities such as Andy Warhol and catching up with some members of her own extraordinary family, including a lesbian aunt who lived with a black actress in Harlem, New York.</p><p>Back in London, Joan ran a hippie restaurant catering for pop festivals. Then she worked at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea, cooking for the actors.</p><p>But it was in the Eighties, when her wartime diaries were published that her fame was ensured. From then on, the heroic drinker, partygoer and sexual chronicler was recognised as a real literary talent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboCTcmdscV9%2FvKK6jJCwp5yYlrpujYydpq2sqWLAprDUnKurnaOoe6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
