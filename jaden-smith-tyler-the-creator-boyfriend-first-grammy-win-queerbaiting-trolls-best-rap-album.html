Not just that, Tyler also delivered one of the best performances of the evening and he eventually bagged the award for the Best Rap Album.</p><p>Just as fans from across the world started congratulating him, Jaden Smith called Tyler, The Creator his "boyfriend".</p><p>"My boyfriend just won a Grammy," Smith <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> after the rapper won the award. The tweet has garnered 44,000 retweets and 355,900 likes.&nbsp;</p><p>The reaction has largely been mixed, but many think they are late to the party. "Sooo Jaden Smith dating Tyler the Creator? I'm not against cause love is love but I'm for late on everything (sic)," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> a user. "Wait, Tyler the creator and Jaden Smith are together? That's cute, but W H A T?" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exclaimed</a> another.</p><p>This is not the first time that Smith has publicly expressed his affection for Tyler. A while time ago, Smith had said during the November 17 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode</a> of Apple Beats Music 1 radio show MSFTS: "I recently said that Tyler, The Creator is my boyfriend and that's true. So just so you know."</p><p>Another time in 2018, Jaden was vocal about his love for the rapper rather loudly while <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shouting</a> into the microphone "I just want to say Tyler, the Creator is the best friend in the world and I love him so f***ing much. And I want to telly ou guys something. I want to tell you. Tyler doesn't want to say, but Tyler's my motherf***ing boyfriend and he's been my motherf***ing boyfriend my whole f***ing life. Tyler, the Creator is my f***ing boyfriend. It's true."</p><p>However, there is enough speculation to infer that this back and forth is a joke and that Jaden does it only for "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trolling</a>" sake. But that has left many <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">upset</a>. "So is tyler the creator/ Jaden Smith actually gay or is this another case of people faking things that shouldn't be faked?"</p><p>"Why is no one calling out Jaden Smith about him treating being gay like its some punch line or joke. We all know Tyler, the Creator isn't his man and yet he is constantly trying to create a false narrative. I'm sick of them both being phoney (sic)," tweeted another upset user.</p><p>"Jaden Smith congratulating his 'boyfriend' tyler the creator enables news outlets to ONCE AGAIN use queer-bait titles. when will we move away from fetishising this community for commercial?" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">vented</a>&nbsp;another.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopGZsq950qagraBdqcatsdFmq6GdXZi%2Fpq3TqKlmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZp6Zp8C1ecarmKalqWLEqrqMqqyenaKXrqrAyKeeZqyipLmtv4ybnKysXaeusXnApZmupQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
