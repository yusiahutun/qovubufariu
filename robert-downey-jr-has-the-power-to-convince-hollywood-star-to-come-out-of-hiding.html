The first of the franchise was the beginning of the Marvel universe and sparked a thirst for superhero films once again. It went on to become a series of phases where the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> studios released more flicks for other incredible stories, such as Thor, Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> has now come out to say it would only ever be Robert Downey Jr who could convince her to get back into the acting game.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-downey-jr-s-power-over-gwyneth-paltrow>Robert Downey Jr’s power over Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-98689015-730x1024.jpg><p>The Se7en star has taken a break from acting in recent years. After a lucrative career in blockbusters, she hasn’t appeared in a full length feature film since Avengers: Endgame. Fair enough, it’s a tough act to follow to be fair. Pepper Potts goes through a lot in the movie, after Gwyneth Paltrow’s character loses Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man after his ultimate sacrifice to save the universe.</p><p>Putting superhero lore aside, Gwyneth has kept a low profile in terms of credits since then.</p><p>She did appear as Georgina Hobart, Ben Platt’s on-screen mom in <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a>‘s The Politician in 2019. The series followed a young man who craves a life in politics and the drastic actions he takes to make it happen.</p><p>Other than that, the <a href=#>Glee</a> star voices an uncredited part in She Said and appears in another Ryan Murphy classic this year. She’s listed as voicing Daphne in American Horror Stories.</p><p>But when it comes to returning to the silver screen, she’s not that convinced. But there is one person who can persuade Gwyneth Paltrow, and that’s none other than Robert Downey Jr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-could-probably-get-me-back>‘He could probably get me back’</h2><p>The CEO is busy at Goop HQ, and admitted to Entertainment Tonight it’s taking all of her attention.</p><p>“It would be very hard for me to do any acting right at the moment, just because of my job.</p><p>“But I guess Robert Downey Jr could always get me back… You know, to some degree.”</p><p>Is this an opener for Rob to pick up the phone, perhaps?</p><p>Gwyneth Paltrow portrayed Pepper Potts, the personal assistant turned love interest of Robert Downey Jr’s character, Tony Stark. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> pair developed a close bond while working together on so many sets. In 2007, the Shakespeare in Love actress also admitted he was the main reason she joined the project in the first place.</p><p>“It had nothing to do with the size of the budget,” She said. “It was like, if I got a call that there’s a six-million-dollar movie, and these are the people, I’d do it.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to work with Robert Downey Jr. He’s a genius, and I had never been asked to do a film with him before.”</p><p>Robert himself even joked Gwyneth was his ‘free pass’ in his marriage to Susan, because how much of good friends they were.</p><p>He told Howard Stern: “My free pass is — because her and Susan are such good friends — is Paltrow</p><p>“I gotta get her back in these movies so I can make out with her onscreen again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-movie-stars-who-love-working-together>Movie stars who love working together</h2><p>The duo starred in seven Marvel films together, which is quite a lot if you consider other on-screen duets. Some other top spots include Amy Adams and Christian Bale. They featured in The Fighter, American Hustle and Vice. Then there is J-Law and <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>, who took part in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Serena. Emma Stone and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> also tie in second place, with Crazy, Stupid, Love, Gangster Squad as well as the acclaimed La La Land.</p><p>We all know one of the champions is probably best friends Seth Rogen and James Franco though. They’ve teamed up for 11 movies together, like Knocked Up, Pineapple Express and This Is The End. We can’t forget <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> and Helen Bonham Carter, either. It’s likely down to their bond with the director Tim Burton as well. Burton often tips Depp as a frequent collaborator, and Carter is his ex-wife. They starred in Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeny Todd, Alice in Wonderland and The Lone Ranger.</p><p>One of our favorite on-screen couples has to be Drew Barrymore and <a href=#>Adam Sandler</a>. The Wedding Singer is still a beloved feature, followed by 50 First Dates and Blended. Lastly, if we consider the kings of comedy, there’s <a href=#>Will Ferrell and John C Reilly – who apparently saw their friendship</a> with another pal suffer over a snub. The pair starred in Talladega Nights, Step Brothers and Holmes and Watson.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WGcL7Om5yrrF2ZvLi6xLJko6pdna60edOhnGaon6yys3nTqGScp56rtq%2BvxGafqKScrsSwu8Nmqq2ZomLBsHnCqKSeZZ%2BqwW67xWafopyZo7Rw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
