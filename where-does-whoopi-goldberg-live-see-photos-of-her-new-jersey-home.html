The beloved <a href=#>View</a> cohost lives <a href=#>in a gorgeous house</a> in a gated community in one of the most private neighborhoods New Jersey has to offer.</p><p>Whoopi first purchased her Georgian Colonial-style mansion, which is located in West Orange, New Jersey, and was built in 1927, over a decade ago in 2009. The Sister Act star’s not-so-humble abode stretches over 9,486 square feet and features eight bedrooms.</p><p>That might sound super impressive, but Whoopi’s incredible home actually boasts 23 rooms in total, according to <a href=#>Heavy</a>. The luxurious dwelling is also fitted with an extravagant kitchen, an indoor gym, a pool and an outdoor patio area.</p><p>The Academy Award winner decorated her grandiose home with mahogany furniture and tons of her favorite paintings and photographs. Whoopi told <a href=#>New York Magazine</a> that her residence is a reflection of her diverse interests in art over the years.</p><p>“I am sort of eclectic,” she explained in April 2012. “The periods kind of clash all over the house, which is great for me — it feels like you can hang out. It’s formal … and yet it doesn’t give a s—t.”</p><p>Aside from living in a gorgeous property with endless lavish amenities, Whoopi said she loves living in New Jersey because of the privacy. “That is what brought me to Jersey, because I lived in the city and had no way of sitting outside,” she told <a href=#>NJ Advance Media</a> in November 2019. “Because every time I go sit outside, 50 people would come and hang out.”</p><p>The Color Purple actress — who is the proud mom of her only daughter, <a href=#><strong>Alex Martin</strong></a> — said while she “[likes] people,” she yearned to live in a place where she “could [be] outside” and go unbothered. “My work partner said, ‘How about New Jersey?’ I said, ‘I don’t know anything about it.’ He said, ‘When you’re ready, let’s go explore.'”</p><p>After locking down her property in 2009, the Golden Globe winner couldn’t be happier. Whoopi dished one of her favorite things about living outside NYC is being a short drive away from the casinos. “I’m also a huge fan of Atlantic City,” she marveled “I love it. And so it’s great to be in New Jersey.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see photos of Whoopi’s enviable mansion!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZq6hp5%2Bltm6zzqWbm52inHqttdWeZKydlWK9qbvTqKpmp5Zitaa%2BjKecsGWamr%2B0sdhmn6illWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
