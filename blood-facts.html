Most of their savory dishes feature blood as a base. Some Asian countries also use animal blood for different types of stew, pudding, and other dishes. However, some cultures see the consumption of blood as a taboo.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>People drink blood, too.</h2><p><span>The Maasai people of Africa mix cow’s blood with cow’s milk as a staple food. They are a herder culture that places high regard for their <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>cows</a>. As such, they don’t kill their livestock. Instead, they nick the jugulars to get blood without killing them.</span></p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>19 Facts About Parkinsons</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>You have more than a gallon of blood in your body.</h2><p><span>The typical adult has about 1.325 gallons of blood. If you lose 40% of your blood, it could be fatal. You could die if you don’t immediately get a transfusion or medical attention. <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pregnant</a> women have 30-50% more blood volume than women who are not pregnant.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>You're made of gold.</h2><p><span>A person weighing 70 kg has 0.2 milligrams of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>gold</a> in their blood (along with iron, chromium, manganese, zinc, lead, and copper). Our bodies have trace amounts of this precious metal.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Insects and invertebrates have blood.&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Blood.jpg><p><span>Next time you squish a bug, take a closer look. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Hemolymph</a> is barely noticeable because it doesn’t have the hemoglobin that makes ours red. Instead, it has a pale and/or yellowish color.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Some animals have blue blood.</h2><p><span>No, they aren’t royalty. But one of the neatest blood facts is that some crustaceans (our crab friends), spiders, octopuses, and squids are blue-blooded because of the protein hemocyanin. Instead of iron, their blood contains more <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">copper</a>.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Some animals bleed green.&nbsp;</h2><p><span>The chlorocruorin blood <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>protein</a> in segmented worms, leeches, and some marine worms makes their blood green.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Some animals have purple blood.</h2><p><span>Perhaps one of the more fabulous blood facts: some creatures bleed purple due to haemerythrin.

In the brain, they filter out cholesterol, calcium plaque, and blood clots. Capillaries recede with age, it this could be a factor in older peoples’ tendency for stroke.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>Scientists didn't figure out the circulatory system until the 17th century.</h2><p><span>William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped through the heart, not the lungs. This is also the guy that was sent by King James I to investigate a woman accused of witchcraft. How did he do it? He <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dissected the poor woman’s pet toad</a> to see if there was anything supernatural to it.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-13>Blood might be used to treat Alzheimer’s.</h2><p><span>Scientists injected old mice with blood plasma from younger mice and found that it improved the older mice’s memory and learning. Additionally, it restored the older mice’s organs. Whether this will work with humans is unknown.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-14>Dogs have more than a dozen blood types.&nbsp;</h2><p><span>It’s not just humans that have blood types. However, we have more variations in types.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-15>People thought a tuberculosis epidemic was vampirism.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shreyas-tiwari-CyWdCRetONQ-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg><p><span>One of the weirder blood facts, </span><span>a <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>tuberculosis</a> epidemic in 19th-century England had the townspeople thinking something supernatural was going on. It doesn’t help that the outbreak occurred at the peak of vampire claims.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-16>Brain freeze is caused by our blood.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sharon-mccutcheon-SGI0i5sHCL8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg><p><span>The notorious <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>ice cream</a> headache is a result of the quick dilation of the brain’s anterior cerebral artery. Sudden temperature changes in the mouth trigger this response which gives us the jarring headache.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-17>O+ is the most common blood type.</h2><p><span>The O+ blood type is the most common, comprising 37.4% of the U.S. population. People with O blood are “universal donors” because their blood doesn’t have antigens. Their blood type is compatible with any receiver. However, they can only receive blood from fellow O blood types.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>AB- is the rarest blood type.</h2><p><span>The AB- blood type is the rarest, making up only 0.6% of the U.S. population. The AB blood type is the “universal receiver” since it has both A and B antigens. Other blood types are usually compatible with them.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-19>The Rhesus factor determines blood types.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/igam-ogam-VV13d2ozcy4-unsplash-1024x737.jpg><p><span>The Rhesus (Rh) factor is a protein in blood that affects compatibility. Most people have Rh+ blood. Rh- blood types can only receive blood from fellow Rh negative donors. Rh+ blood types can receive from both Rh+ and Rh- donors. Transfusion of incompatible blood types can be fatal, since opposite antigens will destroy each other. This could make life-threatening situations even worse. Thankfully, the medical process of donating and transfusing blood is stricter and more thorough now.</span></p><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
