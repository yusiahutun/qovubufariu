She told <a href=#><strong>Variety</strong></a> in a joint interview with co-star and executive producer <a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> that she felt protected at all times with director Mimi Leder. "I never felt uncomfortable," Aniston noted.</p><p>On top of that, she had nothing but praise for her scene partner in that potentially awkward encounter. "Jon was such a gentleman, always," she said. "I mean every move, every cut, 'You okay?'"</p><p>"It was also very choreographed," she added. "That's the beauty of Mimi and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don't prepare."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1a2ebb4f-5318-4ed5-af3c-4877071c49cc data-container-ref=toofab:article:436a300b-54dd-49b0-85ef-f24d0c923dd8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/73/5by4/2023/09/28/731004b847e54a96b4ae55dd4183cb01_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Zoey Groosman</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Aniston Flaunts Toned Body as She Strips Down to Bra and Underwear for New Photoshoot</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Aniston said that another reason for her decision to film sans intimacy coordinator is because she's "from the olden days," meaning she wasn't entirely sure what what that would even mean for this scene. "They said, 'Where someone asks you if you're okay,' and I'm like, 'Please, this is awkward enough!'"</p><p>"We're seasoned," she emphasized of herself and her scene partner. "We can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there."</p><p>Aniston noted that she's known "the Hammanator for a long, long time," with her and co-star Reese Witherspoon marveling that they both met him through <a href=#><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a>. For Aniston, it was 12 years ago, 1996 for Witherspoon.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0dcae3eb-b41c-435d-8d55-d6482949fc13 data-container-ref=toofab:article:436a300b-54dd-49b0-85ef-f24d0c923dd8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/5by4/2023/11/30/d704d0582c0a425c8f634aa66ea3f632_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC / FX</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jon Hamm Recalls Using 'C--k Sock' For Fargo Nude Scene After Revealing Fake Nipple Piercings</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Two weeks ago, Hamm opened up with <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> about another recent nude scene of his in <a href=#><strong>Fargo</strong></a>, though this one wasn't an intimate scene. Instead, he was just hanging naked in a hot tub.</p><p>"I thought I had a rider in my contract [that said] naked is fine, cold naked is not great," Hamm said to Kimmel.
