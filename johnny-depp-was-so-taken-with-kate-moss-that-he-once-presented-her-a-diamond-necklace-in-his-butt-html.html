But he’s also known for his string of high-profile relationships with some of the most famous women in Hollywood.</p><p id=par-2_27>From <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a> to Amber Heard, many of Depp’s romances have made headlines for being some of the most iconic — and tumultuous — relationships in history.</p><p id=par-3_48>But his relationship with supermodel <a href=#>Kate Moss </a>was an ongoing hot topic. Not only because their love was one of a kind, but due to the fact that their courtship involved champagne-filled bathtubs, high-fashion moments, and a diamond necklace held in a place where the sun doesn’t shine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Johnny-Depp-and-Kate-Moss.jpg><h2>Johnny Depp started dating Kate Moss after his whirlwind romance with Winona Ryder</h2><p id=par-4_19>Before meeting and falling in love with Moss, Depp had a passionate romance with Edward Scissorhands co-star, Winona Ryder.</p><p id=par-5_25>The two were head over heels in love with each other and shared many common interests, including a mutual passion for literature and beat poetry.</p><p id=par-6_26>The two got engaged after just five months of dating, and during that time, Depp famously got a tattoo dedicated to Ryder that read, “Winona Forever.”</p><p id=par-7_38>From an outside perspective, it seemed Depp and Ryder were going to be together for the rest of their lives. But unfortunately, that didn’t happen as the pair called it quits in 1993 after three years of dating.</p><p id=par-8_48>Though he was <a href=#>“never the same”</a> after his split from the Beetlejuice actor, the Pirates of the Caribbean star soon found comfort in the arms of a high-profile model (better known as Kate Moss) who was not only the life of the party but also a hard-core lover.</p><h2>Inside Johnny Depp and Kate Moss’ relationship</h2><p id=par-9_36>Depp and Moss, who is 11-years his junior, first crossed paths at a New York City café in 1994. The model claims she knew from the moment she and Depp spoke that they’d end up together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kate-Moss-and-Johnny-Depp.jpg><p id=par-10_20>“I knew from the first moment we talked that we were going to be together,” she said, according to <a href=#>People.</a></p><p id=par-11_31>As for Depp, he instantly fell for Moss and was so smitten with her, that he once presented her a diamond necklace stuffed between his butt cheeks, according to <a href=#>Page Six.</a></p><p id=par-12_21>From there, the couple established a glamorous yet volatile romance filled with extensive partying, hotel-trashing, and (extremely) public displays of affection.</p><p id=par-13_56>According to People, Depp and Moss couldn’t take their “hands, lips, mouths, or legs off each other.” The Alice in Wonderland star even claimed that his and Moss’ attraction for each other was so strong, that they had sex in all 63 rooms (<a href=#>including 23 suites and four bungalows</a>) of the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood.</p><h2>Johnny Depp and Kate Moss broke up after four years together</h2><p id=par-14_35>Though their relationship had some dark moments, Moss says no one ever cared for her as much as Depp. So, when they broke up in 1998 after spending four years together, the supermodel was devastated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Johnny-Depp-and-Kate-Moss-1.jpg><p id=par-15_65>“There’s nobody that’s ever really been able to take care of me. Johnny did for a bit. I believed what he said,” Moss spilled to <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. “Like if I said, ‘What do I do?’ he’d tell me. And that’s what I missed when I left. I really lost that gauge of somebody I could trust. Nightmare. Years and years of crying. Oh, the tears!”</p><p id=par-16_28>As for Depp, he blamed himself for his breakup with Moss, telling <a href=#>Hello! Magazine</a> that he gave more attention to his career than he did to the model.</p><p id=par-17_63>“I have never got that emotional over a woman before. I have been so stupid because we had so much going for our relationship,” he told the outlet. “I’m the one who has to take responsibility for what happened—I was difficult to get on with, I let my work get in the way, and I didn’t give her the attention I should have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW7DwKxkrKddqa6ssc1mrqKsmGK4osDEZqSoq6Niwamt02afnmWfo7Cmec%2BrnKydnqmypXnHnqlmmV2ZtqK5zqebZqaVmLitrcKeZKKmXZ22tHnBrqutZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
