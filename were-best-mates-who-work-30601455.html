us in a joint interview with the beauties.</p><p>"So we were at the gym the other day, we do personal training sessions together.</p><p>"Our personal trainer Christie is so fascinated by what we do and how much we make – she can't believe it.</p><p>"She was like 'what's on your <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>OnlyFans</a>' and I told her 'well, mine is mainly lingerie and bikinis and stuff that's a little bit cheekier'.</p><p>"And then she asked 'and the joint one' and I told her it's the same content.</p><p>"She said 'oh I thought you had sex with each other'.</p><p>"I wouldn't let her [Laura] touch me with a f***ing barge poll!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

suggestively on their collaborative account, they don't even cross the line by getting X-rated.</p><p>But due to their sexy business, many assume otherwise.</p><p>Nina and Laura say many mistakenly think they do porn, which isn't true.</p><p>"I couldn't believe (people) said that, I asked her if other people think we f***," Nina gasped.</p><p>Laura added: "Well, sex sells so it works in our favour."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The women giggled as Nina continued: "I think sometimes we imply that maybe we do but we don't.</p><p>"You've got to be very careful on OnlyFans as say, for example, if I were to sell a video that said 'this is me and Laura doing this' and it's just a photo of me and Laura in lingerie, I could get my whole account removed completely.</p><p>"It's because it's fraud, it's scamming someone isn't it, so you've got to be careful.</p><p>"There is an indication that there is some cheekier stuff going on but we're not saying it.</p><p>"So it's all quite mild for how much we make!"</p><p>Nina and Laura claim to have made six figures each from their personal accounts and rake in at least £4,000 a month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

from their separate endeavours.</p><p>And even a 'bad' month is pretty good for the sizzling hot models.</p><p>"The highest I've ever made in a month is about £25,000," Nina claimed.</p><p>"And the lowest we ever make in a month is about £5,000, £4,000-£5,000 would be a bad month.</p><p>"When she got it, she made about £40,000 instantly."</p><p>Laura admitted: "It was mad."</p><p>You can follow
