This announcement came through an open letter shared on Tuesday, January 30, in which UMG expressed their stance on critical issues, including fair compensation for artists and songwriters, protection against AI’s harmful effects on human artists, and ensuring online safety for TikTok users.</p><p>UMG claimed that TikTok tried to coerce them into accepting a deal that was significantly less favorable than the previous one, not reflective of fair market value, and did not acknowledge TikTok’s exponential growth. The alleged intimidation involved selectively removing the music of certain developing artists while retaining the content of globally recognized stars on the platform.</p><p>In response to UMG’s decision, TikTok accused the music giant of prioritizing “their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters.” The platform argued that, despite Universal’s claims, they have opted to walk away from a platform with over a billion users, serving as a crucial promotional and discovery tool for UMG talent.</p><p>UMG, home to the catalogs of renowned artists like <strong>Billie Eilish, Drake, Ariana Grande, BTS</strong>, and <strong>SZA,</strong> has been a dominating force in the music industry. The current agreement allows TikTok access to approximately three million recorded tracks and four million songs whose publishing is represented by UMG, making this withdrawal a significant development in the digital music landscape. The dispute between UMG and TikTok adds another layer to the ongoing discussions surrounding fair compensation and ethical considerations in the evolving relationship between music labels and streaming platforms.</p><p>TikTok statement in response to Universal Music Group</p><p><span>“It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters.</span></p><p><span>Despite Universal’s false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent.</span></p><p><span>TikTok has been able to reach ‘artist-first’ agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal’s self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.”</span></p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJFoZ2pnpJ64tbvKZqmeq6Cku6W%2FjJqlnWWRmLC2v8SsZK6ll2K8p3nGq5yenF2Wr7DCxGaroZ1dnru1sdGeqq2rXaSzbq3RraCsrKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
