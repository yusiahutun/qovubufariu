But one New Year's image is enduring: that of a new baby, sometimes donning a top hat and sash. Doesn't ring a bell? Here's everything worth wondering about the centuries-old Baby New Year.</p><img alt="illustration for new year postcard featuring old father time and baby new year with calendar showing january 1" title="New Year's card." width=1302 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/baby-new-year-father-time2-1606770019.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Jim Heimann Collection</span><p>A postcard from 1900 depicting Baby New Year and Father Time.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Who Is Baby New Year?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Baby New Year is an illustration of a baby, sometimes depicted with a hat or sash, who represents the birth of the new calendar year. He is often seen alongside Father Time, the now-grown Baby New Year from the previous year. At the end of each year, Father Time bestows the wisdom and knowledge he's learned over the course of the year to the newly born Baby New Year, who will spend the year growing and learning before passing on his knowledge as Father Time next January 1, and so forth. (Father Time is often seen with a scythe because he is based on the Roman god Saturn, who was tied to farming and was celebrated with harvest-time festivities. The scythe is a symbol of the endurance of time, which will never stop and will eventually "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/did-father-time-have-children data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cut down" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">cut down</a>" all living things.) Together, the illustrated figures of Baby New Year and Father Time are personifications of the passage of time giving way to the vibrancy of a brand-new year.</p><img alt="printed between 1923 and 1929, charles mather company of chicago published over 300 motivational posters for placement in factories and offices in an effort to improve worker productivity and happiness 1923 goodbye old year, good bye old faults, old complaints, old grievances good bye grouches, good bye bad habits, good bye pessimism, good bye hard times, welcome a fresh start happy new year to you photo by david pollackcorbis via getty images" title="Mather Work Incentive Poster, Goodbye Old Year" width=5105 height=3430 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/baby-new-year-father-time4-1606769537.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">David Pollack</span><p>Charles Mather Company of Chicago published more than 300 motivational posters in an effort to improve worker productivity and happiness between 1923 and 1929.

Every year, the Greeks celebrated Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility, and this celebration would include parading a baby through the streets in a basket, which represented Dionysus's birth. The babe's image was carried on in early Christian celebrations, where he also represented Baby Jesus.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">By the early 1900s, Baby New Year was still going strong, even immortalized further by illustrator (and Norman Rockwell mentor) J.C.
