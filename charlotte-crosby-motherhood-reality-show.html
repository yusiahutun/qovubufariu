itemprop=articleBody><p>IF you’ve been wondering where Charlotte Crosby’s disappeared to you should look in her home city of Sunderland.</p><p>The former <a href=#>Geordie Shore</a> star has been making a reality show on Wearside where she’ll be seen running her business while preparing for motherhood with boyfriend <a href=#>Jake Ankers</a>.</p><img

iPlayer, and aims to showcase everything that’s good about the North-East.</p><p>She said: “I am beyond excited to be bringing my crazy life, my business ventures, much loved family, future hubby and my precious bump to the BBC.”</p><p>Bosses behind the ten-part series say it will provide an “honest and surprising lens on the multi-faceted world of Charlotte”.</p><p>She will be seen with close friends and family, and viewers will even witness the moment boyfriend Jake, a Mancunian businessman, moves in with her and they <a href=#>prepare to become parents</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Charlotte Crosby">Read more on Charlotte Crosby</h2><p>It’s bound to be a particularly emotional experience as Charlotte had an ectopic pregnancy in 2016 with her then boyfriend <a href=#>Gaz Beadle</a>, who starred with her on Geordie Shore.</p><p>She said she suffered from PTSD as a result of the near-fatal ordeal.</p><p>But she’s now had an ultrasound scan and has even revealed she feels confident enough to have picked names for her baby.</p><p>She said last month: “Seeing the baby in the correct place with a healthy, beating heart at our first-ever scan was nothing short of a miracle to me and my partner.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Since finding fame on Geordie Shore more than a decade ago Charlotte has developed a huge social media presence, with almost eight million followers on Instagram alone.</p><p>I reckon the BBC will be happy if just a fraction of those watch her new show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

few could match <a href=#>The X Factor</a> in its heyday.&nbsp;</p><p>So I’m not surprised ITV has looked to the defunct talent behemoth to inspire a shake-up on <a href=#>The Voice</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000642445697.jpg><p>Coaches Olly Murs, Tom Jones, Anne-Marie et al will now have more amateur crooners to choose from than ever before – as the show has invited groups to apply for the first time ever.</p><p>Since its launch in 2012 on BBC1, only solo stars were able to grace the stage.</p><p>A source said: “Opening up to duos and trios will change the dynamic of the show.</p><p>“The X Factor spawned some of the globe’s most successful groups, so no wonder ITV wants to bring in some of that magic.”</p><p>ITV, who have broadcast the show since 2017, said the change will be introduced for the 2023 series, with applications open now.</p><p>PETER SAWKINS, winner of 2020’s <a href=#>Great British Bake Off</a>, celebrated Pride Month by announcing his same-sex relationship.</p><p>He posted a video of himself in Morocco holding hands with a mystery man, captioned: “You only live once, and when you do it right, once is enough.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>RIVER IS SO DEEP – HUGH</h2><p>IT’S been 25 years since <a href=#>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</a> first brought River Cottage to our screens – but the telly chef says the programme’s quiet activism feels more relevant than ever.</p><p>Ahead of a brand new series – back after a decade off air – Hugh said: “I think people’s interest in this way of living is now stronger than ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000041915962.jpg><p>“If anything’s changed it’s that we have an extra level of responsibility for the natural world this time round, and a little more emphasis on our well-being.”</p><p>Hugh has welcomed a ‘bee whisperer’ to his band of experts. He added: “Learning about the ways we can help bees to be more resilient by creating more natural, wild hives is something I can’t get bored of.”</p><p>Find out more on River Cottage Reunited, tonight at 9pm on More 4.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=has-text-align-center>LOU NEW BEEB GIG</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>LOUISE Minchin </a>will be back on the BBC ten months after leaving its Breakfast show.</p><p>The TV journalist, who hopped over to ITV to check into I’m A Celebrity during her time away from Auntie, announced that she will cover Pick Of The Week on Radio 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000714259163.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGloboB4f5JsZpygkae5sMDTnmScqp%2Bor7p5zKiroZ2inbywsIyrnJqkmanGbr%2FHqK5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
