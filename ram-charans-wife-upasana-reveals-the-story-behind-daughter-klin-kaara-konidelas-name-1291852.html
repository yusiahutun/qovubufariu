She's the daughter of Mega Power Star Ram Charan and Upasana Kamineni Konidela. But what sets her name apart is the fascinating story.&nbsp;</p><p>Upasana, the child's mother, recently revealed in an interview that Klin Kaara was named in a special ceremony by a tribal group from the Ahmedabad reserve forest. Surprisingly, she also shared that her own mother had initially wanted to name her Klin Kaara.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mom wanted to name me that, but now Kaara is named,” said Upasana in an interview with idream media. “But she is a tribal girl. She was named in a traditional way by the tribes of Ahmedabad Tiger Reserve, so they came and did her naming ceremony,” the entrepreneur mother added.&nbsp;</p><p>Ram Charan’s wife takes immense pride in giving her child such a distinctive name. Derived from the Lalitha Sahasranamam, the name holds deep significance, symbolizing transformative and purifying energy that sparks spiritual enlightenment. Furthermore, Sahasranamam is a sacred mantra in Hindu mythology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Upasana cherishes the association of her child with tribal roots, as the name was bestowed with blessings from the Chenchu tribal Goddess Bhauramma Devi.&nbsp; <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Klin Kaara Konidela entered the world on June 20th, 2023, at Apollo Hospital Jubilee Hills. <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Ram Charan’s wife Upasana REVEALS the story behind daughter Klin Kaara Konidela’s name ","1291852","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ram-charan-clicked-with-wife-upasana-daughter-klin-kaara-as-they-jet-off-from-hyderabad-ahead-of-his-birthday-1289689","articlepage","/entertainment/south/ram-charans-wife-upasana-reveals-the-story-behind-daughter-klin-kaara-konidelas-name-1291852","Ram Charan and Upasana","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","south")'>Ram Charan and Upasana</a> had Klin Kaara after 11 years of marriage.
