During her last pregnancy, Rihanna stepped out in groundbreaking maternity style—from paparazzi shots outside of celebrity hotspots to full glamor on the cover of Vogue, Rihanna made a point to show off her bump—and based off of her Superbowl performance and pregnancy reveal, she is planning on doing so again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>ICYMI, Rihanna is pregnant—she and A$AP Rocky are going to be parents for a second time! Rihanna made the announcement with a bump reveal during her Superbowl performance with an unzipped jumpsuit and confirmed the speculation shortly after.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-2023-10-03T104916.312.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/asap-rihanna.png><p><span>The best part of Rihanna’s pregnancy style is that she is fully aware of the power each accessory she chooses has and how her sheer, cropped and low-rise choices will ultimately change the expectation of maternity fashion. In <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rihanna’s previous interview with Vogue</a> she said, “t</span><span>here’s no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle. I’m sorry—it’s too much fun to get dressed up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>In honor of baby number two and an entire second season of unmatched pregnancy style, keep scrolling for every single one of Rihanna’s most iconic pregnancy looks—and be sure to check back as we are blessed with more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1465426806.jpg><p>Rihanna wore a bright red Loewe jumpsuit (with a well placed zipper to show off her bump) with a matching red Loewe bralette for her Superbowl halftime performance. The look created a strong contrast against the crowd of backup dancers in all-white puffer suits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1246972796.jpg><p>At the Apple Music Superbowl Half Time Show press conference, Rihanna wore a snakeskin look by Alaïa. This appearance was a few days before she announced her pregnancy and she used the shearling jacket to strategically cover up her bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA845402_001.jpg><p>This photo and the ones below are from Rihanna’s first pregnancy. In this outing, the Umbrella&nbsp;singer took it upon herself to give a matching set new life. The singer wore a dark blue knit set from Alaïa with sporty Adidas sneakers and a matching blue camo Dior saddle bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA843925_002.jpg><p>When Rihanna isn’t flaunting her bump in a crop top, she opts for elevated casual looks. This Mickey Mouse graphic tee may be covering her bump, but she still gets her point across with the “baby daddy” reference in the text. The ever-trendy baggy jeans and long layered gold necklaces turn the cheeky t-shirt into a full-on&nbsp;look.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA834777_001.jpg><p>Minimalism plays no part in Rihanna’s maternity style. For a night out to dinner, Rihanna wore a bright aqua jumpsuit by Stella McCartney with perfectly placed oblique cutouts. She took her accessory game up a notch and wore matching blue sunglasses and heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA833045_014.jpg><p>Ever one to make an entrance, RiRi showed up to the Dior show at Paris Fashion Week wearing literal lingerie. As! Only! She! Can!! Her getup included a lacy black bra with matching panties, a high-waisted netted skirt that was completely see-through, some tall black boots and a black leather coat worn slouched on her shoulders.</p><p>Not only is the look glam and statement-making, but it’s also well-accessorized. If her announcement photos taught us anything, we know Ri loves to pile on the jewelry right now! She complemented her all-black ensemble with a blingy diamond choker and two chunky silver chain necklaces bearing a cross and a fleur de lis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA833045_030.jpg><p>I’m obsessed with how Ri refuses to cover up during her pregnancy—and in a recent <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Refinery29</a>, she clarified why she isn’t shying away from her usual bold style.</p><p><span>“When women get pregnant, society tends to make it feel like you hide, hide your <a href=# rel=nofollow>sexy</a>, and that you’re not sexy right now [but] you’ll get back there and I don’t believe in that sh*t,” she told Refinery29. “So I’m trying stuff that I might not have even had the confidence to try before I was pregnant. The strappiest, the thinnest, and the more cut-outs the better for me.”</span></p><p>And this wasn’t her only great Paris Fashion Week ensemble! Rihanna also donned a pretty peach leather mini dress to the Off-White show, styled with lace-up snakeskin sandals, a long shearling coat, a smattering of gold necklaces and a micro Dior saddle bag in ostrich leather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP22059835260078.jpg><p>Of course, it would be remiss of me to not shout out perhaps her best maternity look to date, worn to celebrate Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin at Goya Studios. She paired shiny straight strands and a vampy red lip with a ridiculously cool look by The Attico, featuring a lime green backless halter top and ombre pants done in a fringy metallic fabric.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP22043498706765.jpg><p>But before we knew there was a baby on board, RiRi was slaying <a href=#>her pregnancy wardrobe</a> in secret—a good coat covers up so much! On January 26, the singer and fashion mogul was spotted at the Flight Club sneaker store in NYC serving major traffic cone elegance. And stopping traffic at the same time, I’m sure!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP22027425766603.jpg><p>Ri layered a bright orange hoodie underneath an oversized orange shearling coat, and threw on a pair of camouflage pants for contrast. As a glam finishing touch, she opted for the Gucci x Balenciaga Knife heels. Iconic, no? And to think, this was just days before her showing off her bump in its full glory! I would’ve never, ever guessed she was expecting—how unexpected, pun very much intended.</p><p>We don’t know when <a href=#>her due date</a> is, but she looks pretty far along, so I’m willing to say she was definitely pregnant in December. Which means this sexy bomber jacket look also counts as part of her pregnancy wardrobe!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA810617_004.jpg><p>The Miu Miu bomber is a statement all on its own, but Ri accessorized with Miu Miu gloves, Balenciaga Knife boots and Loewe sunnies that give major Willy Wonka vibes. Again, in a good way. IDK how anyone but Rihanna pulls these off. Regardless, the bomber’s oversized, slightly rounded silhouette was perfect for hiding any hint of a pregnant belly.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykscuemauhpK56rbvOpKpoaWJqfXN9l2ipoqCRo7uiec%2BrnKCmkaOwunnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
