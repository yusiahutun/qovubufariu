But times are clearly changing.When the 31-year-old monarch asked his people if he should go one step futher&nbsp;and give his nervous-looking Queen Jetsun Pema a peck on the lips – the excited crowd roared a resounding "yes".So he obliged, planting another tender kiss on the stunning 21-year-old, <a class=hm-link href=#>an airline pilot's daughter</a>.Watching on were the&nbsp;four 'Queen Mothers' – four sisters who King Jigme's father, the fourth&nbsp;Dragon King, married&nbsp;– and all began clapping and cheering wildly.The touching and intimate moment – so removed from the solemnity of the deeply formal event, is typical of the thoroughly modern couple.King King Jigme Khesar Namgel Wangchuck and his bride have charmed the country with their accessible nature and their open adoration.
