The footage showed Alexis reenacting an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>infamous Sam-Ron fight</strong></a> from the show's early days over his friendship with Jenni "JWoww" Farley.</p><p>Alexis' caption for the video: "Angela, I'M friends with her!!!"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>"Angela," of course, is Angelina.</p><p>Now, some backstory. In September 2023, Alexis took to TikTok to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>call out Pivarnick for slipping into her husband's DMs</strong></a>, sending him a message saying, "see u soon." Bawden exposed the DM, before telling Angelina -- who she repeated called "Angela" in the video -- "You don't message a married woman’s man you’re going to see him soon after you see his wife go by on the field. Weirdo."</p><p>That drama already played out earlier this season, with Pivarnick saying she DMed a number of the players and didn't know Bawden was married when she reached out to him.</p><p>It all seemed like it had blown over, until Sam decided to appear in Alexis' video.</p><p>"You have to see this bulls--t!" exclaimed Pivarnick after she learned about the TikTok. Angelina went on to say Sam wasn't living up to her "sweet" reputation, instead calling her the "meanest bitch" she's ever met. "F--k you," she exclaimed as she continued to rant about the apparent slight, which came after <a href=#><strong>ongoing drama between the two women</strong></a>.</p><p>Even their costars knew the video would cause serious drama, as they all braced for Hurricane Angelina to hit.</p><p>"Once you put something on social media, it's there forever. Girl, what are you doing?!" exclaimed Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, while Deena Nicole Cortese said she'd never make a video like that because she's "too afraid" of Angelina's wrath.</p><p>"That was a chess move. Don't f--k with Sam, is what I'm saying," said Pauly D in reaction to the video, while Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino felt Sam "definitely poked the hamster with that TikTok."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f9bcc4a9-1b5f-480c-81aa-44c51850b1c6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8de39feb-3a5e-4440-89b0-38cecabd702e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cd/5by4/2024/03/14/cdf77c4198b7472cafee5c721f644084_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sammi Sweetheart Slams 'Jealous' Angelina Pivarnick, Refuses to 'Bow Down' on Jersey Shore</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The video came out right before the whole group was set to head to Arizona together for another trip and they all expected serious drama from Angelina once they got there. Sam, however, defended herself while speaking with Jenni, Nicole and Deena, saying she wasn't intentionally trying to tick off anyone with the TikTok.</p><p>"Me and Justin went to a Jets-Giants game and I got this amazing opportunity to watch the game from the Jets special lounge and guess who's there," she said. "I was there all day with her for four hours and she's a very nice girl. There was no ill intent on my end."</p><p>"You know how awkward it was when I saw this girl? I'm not the one who wrote the caption, I'm not the one who posted it," she added. "There was no ill-intent on my end."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:75508b19-3272-4bec-b7ac-4a2cb469b0ec data-container-ref=toofab:article:8de39feb-3a5e-4440-89b0-38cecabd702e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/55/5by4/2024/03/07/558b131491f04e92941e3c7f555600e8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Toddler' Angelina and 'Unappreciative Bitch' Sammi Get Into Nasty Fight on Jersey Shore</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She went on to say that Angelina "annoys" her in general and, referring to their past issues, said she knew Pivarnick wouldn't even "own up" to her own part in any of their ongoing drama.</p><p>The episode ended just after Angelina and her man, Vinny Tortorella, arrived at the AZ resort -- meaning any showdown between her and Sam will have to wait until next week.
