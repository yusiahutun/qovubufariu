But the Asian art market appears to have cooled substantially in recent weeks because of economic and political uncertainties. Bidding began at HK$300 million and quickly stalled at a phone bid of HK$380 million before Rebecca Wei, Christie’s Asia president, bumped it up to HK$390 million with another offer made over the phone. Just one more competing bid was made before her anonymous buyer put the price up to the final hammer price HK$410 million less than three minutes after the sale started. The final price includes the HK$53.6 million charged by the auction house in commissions.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">US$450 million paid for Da Vinci Jesus painting at New York auction</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/26/3c0f1786-f17c-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_1320x770_213838.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The auction house also saw lacklustre demand during its Asian 20th century and contemporary art evening sale on Saturday. The final tally for the sale was HK$425.3 million, including fees – a far cry from the HK$1.56 billion that was recorded at Sotheby’s evening sale in Hong Kong at the end of September. Some of the gap was down to the lack of aggressive bids for the oil paintings of Zao Wou-Ki, the prolific French-Chinese modern artist whose works have come to dominate the top tier of the Asian art market in recent years. Heightened concerns over a US-China trade war and the recent sell-off in the stock and property markets lent a more cautious air to the Hong Kong saleroom this month. The timing of Christie’s evening sale also coincided with elections in Taiwan, where a many Zao collectors live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/26/7258ea38-f17c-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_1320x770_213838.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Qi Baishi paintings fetch record US$141 million at auction</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In private, collectors and dealers have expressed scepticism over the authentication of a painting as old as a thousand years, especially one that had never been seen in public before or had belonged to a thoroughly documented imperial collection. But Christie’s maintains that while there are few examples of Su’s paintings for comparison, the colophons – or inscriptions – by Su’s contemporary Mi Fu cast aside any doubt. The painting is a faded monochrome of a gnarled tree and a strangely shaped rock, and it is a relatively diminutive 50cm wide. But it is mounted on a much longer scroll, on which Mi and three other calligraphers had written their thoughts about the painting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was sold to Japan in the 1930s and the current seller is believed to be Japanese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huang’s painting is not the most expensive lot of Chinese painting and calligraphy to be auctioned.
