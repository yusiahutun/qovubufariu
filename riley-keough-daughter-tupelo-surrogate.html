I was like, 'This is great because it's not really a well-known word or name in relation to my family -- it's not like Memphis or something," she told the publication. "Then when the Elvis movie came out, it was like, Tupelo this and Tupelo that. I was like, 'Oh, no.' But it's fine."</p><p>Storm, meanwhile, is a tribute to her late brother Benjamin Storm Keough, who died in 2020 at the age of 27.</p><p>Opening up about her surrogate, she told Vanity Fair surrogacy is "a very cool, selfless, and incredible act that these women do to help other people." She added, "I can carry children, but it felt like the best choice for what I had going on physically with the autoimmune stuff," referring to her own battle with Lyme disease.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6a558253-0e47-44e0-9367-35e86cad9dea data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ecafaf8-3f37-4f3d-b47d-915cf49973dc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/00/5by4/2023/06/16/00af668ba0e1433b8b0c9978c9f6d946_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Priscilla Presley Says 'Elvis Would Be Proud' of Riley Keough Settlement Over Lisa Marie's Trust</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"This is the thing in my life so far that I have really wanted to, quote-unquote, get right," Keough said of motherhood. "I don't think you ever can be a perfect parent, but I would like to be the best mom for her that I can be. That's ... Very important to me."</p><p>"I remember it so vividly, I just knew that we were going to have kids," she said of her husband. "It was, in hindsight, very strange.
