Elvis Presley's doctor remarked after the singer's death in 1977 from an overdose of Placidyls (a drug used to combat insomnia) that 'Elvis's problem was he didn't see anything wrong in taking the pills. He felt by getting-them from a doctor, he wasn'tthe everyday junkie'.<br></p><p>Moreover, it has been revealed following the very public shaming of Tiger Woods that he has used prescription drugs such as Vicodin and Ambien (a sleeping pill known for its aphrodisiac properties).</p><p>According to Dr Howard Markel, a profession of psychiatry at Michigan University: 'The misuse of those drugs has become one of the major health problems of our time. Teens don't want to just drink, they want to take a pill because it's so easy to get and some of them can really make you feel good.'</p><p>This has spawned the socalled 'pharm party', where teenagers raid their parents' medicine cabinets, then pool resources. There are even 'recipe' internet sites, which explain how and which drugs can be mixed.</p><p>Indeed, anyone with a credit card can go online and get legal - but lethal - pills delivered anywhere in the world. After a few clicks on the internet yesterday, I found every kind of OTC and prescription drug on offer.</p><p>Miss Murphy's husband said he didn't want an autopsy performed on his wife but he has been over-ruled by the coroner.</p><p>For the fact is, this may be the only way to be sure if a cocktail of pills played any part in the actress's untimely death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhra2drg3R7op6jnpqinsG6ec%2Bio6VloKS9sbHRrGSroaOgeqWxwK2fZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
