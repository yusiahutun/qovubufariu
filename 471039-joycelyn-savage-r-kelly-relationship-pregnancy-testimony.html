The posts claimed that R. Kelly controlled her when she ate, bathed, and used the bathroom. Furthermore, the singer decided the people she could speak to and always wanted her to address him as Daddy or Master.</p><p class=align-left>Once when she failed to address him as required, the post said Kelly choked her until she blacked out. Joycelyn quickly released a video claiming that the posts made on Patreon were fake. Joycelyn contended that the allegations that Kelly had abused her were nonsense.

Kelly was already in jail for over a year.</p><p class=align-left>When R. Kelly’s lawyer responded to her claims, Savage said that she and Kelly did IVF (In vitro fertilization) because, at the time, she was told she could not have a baby.
