There, Manganiello was being honored with the COAF Humanitarian Award.</p><p>In January, Vergara opened up about why she and the <a href=#><strong>True Blood</strong></a> actor ultimately split. "My marriage broke up because my husband was younger; he wanted to have kids and I didn't want to be an old mom," Vergara told Spanish newspaper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>El País</strong></a>, according to a translation. Vergara is 51 years old while Manganiello is 47.</p><p>"I feel it's not fair to the baby. I respect whoever does it, but that's not for me anymore," she continued.</p><p>"I had a son at 19, who is now 32," she added, referring to her son Manolo, whom she shares with her ex-husband Joe Gonzalez. "And I'm ready to be a grandmother, not a mother. So, if love comes along, he has to come with [his own] children."</p><a id=gallery-link-490f1756-f699-4a99-9d7d-9d25142ece5e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:490f1756-f699-4a99-9d7d-9d25142ece5e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7164d38b-effe-4b88-ad45-b434f8fcbe3f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/4by3/2024/04/15/fb24da6a64f34637bbc0b88edbbf7d6d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mam5fqLyntcBmrZ6ql5a%2FonnGqJysZZmjwLWtxquYpmWfm7Oqr8iao2avmam1brDRZqGuq6Seu26%2FwKWgppmeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
