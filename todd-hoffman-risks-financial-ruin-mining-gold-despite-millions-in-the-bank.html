The miner and his family are determined to make it work this season but personality clashes threaten their progress. As the Hoffmans return to get the gold, fans want to know more about the <strong>Gold Rush</strong> star’s net worth.</strong></p><p>Despite having some doubts about whether the season will be fruitful, Todd went into season two with a “killer crew” and likened the hunt for gold to “going to war.” All kinds of obstacles are in Todd Hoffman’s way during Hoffman Family Gold, including his own son, Hunter Hoffman. Hunter goes off on his own during season 2, and some of the family members think the move could make more money for the crew overall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-17-at-15.46.02-1024x465.png><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gold-rush-todd-hoffman-s-net-worth>Gold Rush: Todd Hoffman’s net worth</h2><p>Todd Hoffman is an OG when it comes to the <a href=#>Gold Rush</a> series.
