What do we know about his past relationships? And what is his dating status now? Find answers below.</span></p><h3><b>Billy Burke Wife</b></h3><p><span>Billy Burke was married to his wife Pollyanna Rose on June 15, 2008. But though it was a good start, ruthless time got the best of them, and the two went separate ways almost a decade later in 2017.</span></p><p><span>After the divorce, Billy and Pollyanna listed their home in Sherman Oaks for $2.75 million. Their past Mediterranean-style house — with open-plan living and dining rooms, an updated kitchen with an island/bar, and four bedrooms and five bathrooms — was built in 1999. It sat on slightly more than a quarter of an acre with a guest house, swimming pool, and tall palms.</span></p><p><span>His ex-wife, Pollyanna is a London, England native who built her career as an actress. She is the daughter of Ray Williams known for her roles as a “Halo Kennedy” in </span><i><span>Luster </span></i><span>(2010), “Jessica” in </span><i><span>Fix </span></i><span>(2008), and Zoe in </span><i><span>StarStreet</span></i><span> (2002).</span></p><p><span>Prior to marrying Billy, Pollyanna was married to the actor Max Brow for 3 years (18 December 2005 – 15 May 2008).</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Billy has dedicated a song to his ex-wife with her name “Pollyanna Rose” as its title.</span></p><h3><b>Does Billy Burke Have A Daughter?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Billy Burke has a daughter named Bluesy LaRue Burke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to him, Bluesy was growing up fast, so much so, she somewhat reflected his on-screen daughter Bella. “Bella’s got an old soul, and I think that I’m already recognizing things that might be looking like an old soul in my kid right now. And I would like that,” the star explained. And it seems he wouldn’t mind if Bluesy grew up to be like Bella.</span></p><p><span>In fact, the actor wanted his daughter to be a worldly person.” I would like her to help me along the way, because parenthood is something that I never even expected to be involved in, and I’m going to need all the help that I can get,” he added.</span></p><p><span>Also, he considered the possibility that if Bluesy were to being him a “pale, sparkly hunk someday to meet Dad,” he would be willing to keep his mind open. But Bluesy was just 14 years of age (in 2022). He still had a few years before she brought home a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, Bluesy was more focused on her career and studies rather than romance. It seems Bluesy’s mother put her in a French school when she had never even heard a word of that language. “It was challenging and tough for her at times but yesterday was her last day and she will actually miss it and now she can speak another language which she’s quite happy about,” Pollyanna expressed.</span></p><p><span>Also, Bluesy was trying hard to master ballet and singing.</span></p><p><span>The little girl last appeared as “Cindy” in the 2019 movie </span><i><span>Booksmart</span></i><span> and was also seen modeling for top companies like </span><i><span>Ralph Lauren</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Like her mother, Bluesy also had a song decided to her name from Billy.</span></p><h3><b>Billy Burke Dating Status</b></h3><p><span>Billy Burke didn’t reveal his dating status as of 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In fact, after his split from his ex-wife, the star never really confirmed any of his relationships.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Billy’s daughter is also the goddaughter of the actress Olivia Wilde.</span></p><h3><b>Billy Burke Past Relationships</b></h3><p><span>Billy Burke’s past relationships are a mystery. However, before meeting his wife Pollyanna Rose, the star seems to have mingled with the Canadian actress, Neve Campbell.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, the two were an item from 2002 to 2004. In between, they even appeared in the movie </span><i><span>Lost Junction</span></i><span> together.</span></p><p><span>However, with that being said, Neve Campbell is married to the British actor John Light whom she reportedly met on the set of the 2001 independent movie they were making together, </span><i><span>Investigating Sex</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>The latter data contradicts the initial one.
