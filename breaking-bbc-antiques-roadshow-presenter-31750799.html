His joy when he discovered a rare Staffordshire pottery owl jug, nicknamed 'Ozzie', was a magic TV moment few will forget."</p><p>The Museum of Royal Worcester also paid tribute in a touching statement. It read: "It is with great sadness we share the news that Henry Sandon passed away on Christmas morning.</p><p>"Our curator and then patron of the Museum for many years, a much-loved expert who shared his knowledge and enthusiasm for pots and Worcester in person, in books and on TV.

They had three sons – David, Peter and John.</p><p>Henry is survived too by three grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Many others have paid tribute to the television star too.</p><p>Auctioneer Phillip Serrell, who has appeared on the likes of Bargain Hunt and Flog It, praised Henry for doing "so much to promote antiques". And Henry certainly had an eye for them.</p><p>He started collection pottery after finding broken plates in his garden near Worcester's cathedral. Some of the pieces in his private collection dated as far back as 100BC.</p><p>Just this year, it was sold at auction. It is estimated to have made around £50,000.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters&nbsp;</i></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZK%2BzscCkoKefXZevpHnAp6uiqaWawG6%2BzpqbrKCfrHqxvsSsnKeslad6dH2WbmdwcWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
