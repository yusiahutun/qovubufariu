New Court. The Inside Story, Robert Hardman spoke to one of <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ former aides who said three things could “kill” The Firm. Luckily, none of them have caused a royal disaster “in two centuries.” Charles was crowned next to his wife, Camilla, in May 2023. It came seven months after the death of his mom and then-monarch, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1243162514-2-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-three-things-king-charles-has-avoided-doing-that-could-kill-the-monarchy>The ‘three things’ King Charles has avoided doing that could ‘kill’ the monarchy</h2><p>According to an ex-aide, several incidents could have caused the royal family to fall, but King Charles has avoided doing them all.</p><p>“The things which can bring a monarchy to an end have not happened in the two centuries since the French showed us that there could be an alternative,” they said.</p><p>“We haven’t lost any major wars. We haven’t had any huge economic disruption. And we haven’t had a monarch who’s behaved really disgracefully.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Queen Camilla is central to Charles’ reign as king – not Prince William, expert says</a></p><p>“It also helped that for more than fifty-five percent of the time, the monarch has been a woman.”</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean the King has been without his hardships. Before he ascended to the throne, his youngest son, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, caused quite a bit of heartache and drams for The Firm when he stepped down as a senior royal in 2020. He and his wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> moved across the pond to California with their children, four-year-old <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a>, two.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-king-could-abdicate-for-william>‘The King could abdicate’ for William</h2><p>There is speculation, however, that Charles, 75, could abdicate as King when he is 80.</p><p>Clive Irving, a royal biographer, said late last year he believes King Charles will abdicate in five years time to make way for the next in line, his eldest <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and his wife. The main reason he is still on the throne at the moment, Irving claims, is for some stability during a “difficult transitional phase.”</p><p>“It may have already been surreptitiously planned that the King will abdicate when he’s 80,” he explained.</p><p>“He [Charles] wants to just have his moment in the limelight for a few years. Make sure that William and Harry are carried through what’s going to be an incredibly difficult transitional phase for the monarchy.”</p><p>William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> will then ascend to take the titles of King and Queen, while Irving believes Charles and Camilla will retire to Balmoral in Scotland for their retirement. This is despite the fact a monarch is usually on the throne until they pass away, as was the case of Elizabeth II, who died at 96. She ruled for a record-breaking 70 years.</p><p>He pledged in his first speech as king to be the UK’s monarch for the “remaining time God grants me.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles only knew the Queen died after being called ‘Your Majesty’ in tragic phone call</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eGcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0mafmqtdoq6vrcaem2asn2Kyt63DnmStoKKasm7Ax6KloKtdqbWiwIycmKdlm565rXnAZqSoppGnsKnFjJqsraCfp3q0rdisZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
