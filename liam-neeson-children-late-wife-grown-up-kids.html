Years later, both kids are all grown up, and forge their own paths in life.</strong></p><p>Legendary actor Liam Neeson is a father to two children, both from his marriage to late wife Natasha Richardson. The couple, who tied the knot in 1994 and stayed married until death came calling, sustained a blissful family, raising their two sons in love.</p><p>Hence, Richardson’s death was heartbreaking not only for Liam Neeson but also for his two sons Michael and Daniel. Over a decade later, the two, who lost their mom at a young age finally learned to come to terms with the loss.</p><p>In a March 2021 interview, Michael <a href=#>opened up</a> about his mom’s death and the impact it had on him. He also disclosed that he often wished for a chance to have adult conversations with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Natasha-Richardson-Liam-Neeson.jpeg><p>According to him, his mom’s <a href=#>death</a> was so sudden, as it came during what would have been a family funfair. Richardson’s son admitted that the incident messed with his mind, and sent him on a bit of a head spin.</p><p>While he could not relive their moments together, the star found solace in his memories of her and archives of all the films she starred in before her demise.</p><p>Motivated by his mom and her works, Michael grew up to pursue a career in showbiz. Today, he and his younger brother strive to keep her memories alive through their work, thoughts and actions. What do we know about <a href=#>Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson’s children</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Liam_Neesons_Children></span><strong>Who Are Liam Neeson’s Children?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Beautiful-Way-Liam-Neesons-Son-Chose-to-Honor-His-Late-Mother-Natasha-Richardson-1024x691.jpeg><p>Liam Neeson has two <a href=#>children</a>, Michael Richardson and Daniel Neeson. The two young men are now rooted in the arts in some way, following in their parent’s footsteps.</p><p>Since losing his wife, Liam never remarried. Rather, he assumed full responsibility for his two sons, a decision that has proven bitter-sweet over the years. Liam Neeson once said of <a href=#>raising</a> his sons:</p><p><strong>“It’s an ongoing joy being a dad. It’s always a joyful worry. No matter what age they are, they’re still going to be your little boy or your little girl. And you are a hostage to love.”</strong></p><p>Now<strong> </strong>aged 27 and 26 respectively, Liam’s kids would hardly consider themselves his little boys. That’s only natural for kids born to famous parents working their way up the ladder in the industry to break away from their parent’s shadows and make names for themselves.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Michael_Richardson></span><strong>Michael Richardson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Michael-Richardson-Bio-Net-Worth-Age-Height-Salary-Wiki-Updated-2022.png><p>Liam Neeson’s first son Michael Richardson came into the world on June 22, 1995. Inspired by his parents’ passions, he developed a love for acting from a young age, making his film debut in the 2013 movie, “Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.”</p><p>Some of his most notable movies include “Broken Symphony,” “Big Dogs,” “Vox Lux,” “Paradise,” and “Cold Pursuits,” among others.</p><p>As his career progressed, Michael figured he needed to break away from his dad’s fame. Hence, he dropped the name, “Neeson,” the first chance he got, and adopted his mom’s last name Richardson.</p><p>Aside from breaking away from his dad’s fame, adopting his mom’s name was also his way of keeping her close. In 2020, Neeson admitted he supported his son’s decision to change his last name, saying he did the right thing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Daniel_Neeson></span><strong>Daniel Neeson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>One year after becoming first-time parents, Liam Neeson and his wife welcomed their second son Daniel Neeson. He was born on August 27, 1996, completing the family of four.</p><p>Like the rest of his family, Daniel grew up nursing a love for acting. He went on to further groom his passion by studying theatre at Tulane University, graduating in 2019.</p><p>Since then, he has made his mark in the entertainment industry, with behind-the-scenes credits in movies like “Suicide Is Easy.”</p><p>Additionally, Daniel ventured into entrepreneurship, setting up an environmentally-friendly clothing line called Pine Outfitters. The brand, established in 2016 is dedicated to “saving the environment and catering a sustainably new and unique style to people who love to have fun in mother nature’s natural beauty,” per the company’s website.</p><p>At this pace, these two would reach the heights of their respective careers, living up to the reputation of their dad, who has <a href=#>starred with the likes of Julia Roberts</a> and ranks among Hollywood’s most-renowned actors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaqtzGalnp2jpLtur8eio52qlaN6ra3TnmSwoZaaeqi%2BzrClZq2gYriqsNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
