Earnings growth for the companies on the Hang Seng Index is expected to quicken to more than 9 per cent next year, it said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city’s stock benchmark has shed 45 per cent since touching a near-record high on February 17, 2021. It has slumped 14 per cent this year, making it the worst-performing prominent stock index globally, as China’s recovery faltered after the promise of the economic reopening fizzled out, and overseas investors shifted their focus to the US and other Asian markets such as Japan and India.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong stocks have a chance of a turnaround from the long-running headwinds,” HSBC Jintrust said. “Liquidity may see significant improvement in the middle of the year. The Fed’s dovish stance will strengthen the downtrend in the yield on longer-dated US bonds. The worst of the liquidity squeeze because of the Fed’s tightening has already passed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HSBC has a 49 per cent stake in the Shanghai-based asset-management firm, which oversees 35 mutual funds with 45.6 billion yuan (US$6.4 billion) in assets. Its Hong Kong Stock Connect Selected Equity Fund has lost 26 per cent of its value this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hang Seng Index is valued at 5.7 times realised earnings, the cheapest among the world’s major markets, the data shows. The gauge now trades at a 4 per cent discount to its book value, compared with an average premium of 18 per cent over the past decade. It jumped 2.5 per cent to 17,043.53 for the steepest gain in six weeks on Thursday.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China delistings rise to near record highs in 2023 amid market sell-off</span></p></a></h3>Amid such beaten-down valuations, sentiment seems to be showing some signs of improvement. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the biggest technology stocks trading in the city, has recovered all the losses spurred by <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a draft proposal governing China’s video game industry</span></a> last Friday, after the regulator said it would reconsider some of the controversial clauses that restrict spending by players.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, bets on monetary easing in the US have been building up recently on signs of cooling inflation, facilitating outflows to cheaper assets elsewhere globally. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond dropped below 3.8 per cent for the first time in five months on Wednesday, suggesting cuts in the borrowing costs are in the offing. The yield hit a 16-year high of 5 per cent in October.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s market may remain subdued initially next year before stocks begin to rise, according to HSBC Jintrust. It prefers major players in the internet and consumer sectors whose earnings may beat expectations. HSBC Jintrust believes stocks with high dividend yields may become more attractive amid falling US interest rates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong’s market may get a double boost from valuation expansion and earnings growth in 2024,” the firm said. “There’s no need to be pessimistic now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW1tbXFiZLWwusZmoqiml2LAtbvCpKpmpZGuerOx1Z6prJ1daIFuuc6nq6GrXZmypLjIp5xmamBngW64yKScpbFdm7KledGaq55lk6rBbq%2FHoqWaZaCkuaqv2GaqrqigpL%2B1ecesmZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
