The hit South Korean dating show is back and here’s everyone in the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/bachelor-in-paradise-spoilers-2023/>Single’s Inferno season 3 cast</a>, so you don’t have to miss out on all the action.</p><p>Single’s Inferno debuted in 2021 and amassed a devoted following due to the shocking and dramatic nature of the show. 12 contestants are put on a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1676671/squid-game-the-challenge-winner/>deserted island</a> called “Inferno” and compete through challenges to couple up. Once a desired couple is matched, they are sent to “Paradise” which is a fancy hotel where they could be able to get to know one another. Along with all the suspense and pairing, a set of panelists comment on the show including comedian Hong Jin-kyung, actress Lee Da-hee, Super Junior member Kyuhyun, rapper Hanhae, and YouTuber Dex.</p><p>However, season 3 is going to be way different from the previous 2. Instead of one Inferno, there will be <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/who-gerry-pick-golden-bachelor/>two simultaneous Inferno</a> islands with different contestants. “What used to be ‘Paradise’ and ‘Inferno’ will change completely,” Yoo Ki Hwan, Netflix’s unscripted lead for Korea, told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/singles-inferno-season-3-date-dex-interview rel=nofollow>Netflix Tudum</a>. “Especially when it comes to ‘Paradise’ — it won’t just be a luxurious resort, but more of a special and intimate place where the couples have a chance to dive deeper into each other’s emotions, elevating the romance.”</p><p>So who’s in the Single’s Inferno season 3 cast?
