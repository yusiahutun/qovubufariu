That’s right, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/policy-campaigns/publications-index/statistics/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="25 per cent of all children in this country are being raised by a solo parent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">25 per cent of all children in this country are being raised by a solo parent</a>. There are loads of us. We’re everywhere. So why does it feel so bloody lonely out here?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today is National Single Parents Day, an occasion to recognise all of us flying solo in the world of parenting. Those of us being a mum and a dad, day in and day out. Keeping a child, or multiple children, alive; food on the table; and everyone (mostly) sane. So, if you’re a single parent reading this, well done you. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/lifestyle_homes/a25315096/a-letter-to-single-mums-how-to-survive-when-its-all-too-much/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keep going, you warrior" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Keep going, you warrior</a>.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“The chances are, as a newly single parent, you’re mostly feeling scared, lost and lonely”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Are you new to single parenthood? The chances are you haven’t quite reached the ‘feeling like a warrior’ phase yet. (If you have, double congratulations, you’re way ahead of the curve.) As a newly single parent, you’re mostly feeling scared, lost, lonely and mildly panicked. And guilty. Guilty whether or not the choice was yours. Guilty that the future you had planned for your child has fallen apart. Or guilty that the future you’ve chosen for your child isn’t the one we’re all told to strive for. So, if you’re reading this, and feeling those things, this goes out to you. Here’s some advice I wish I had heard at the start. I wish my former self could see how far I have come.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">1 Don’t look too far ahead</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is important. Whether it’s a break-up, a break-down or any other circumstance that has led you to single parenthood, it can feel completely hopeless. If you’re looking ahead to a divorce, taking on a mortgage or bigger rent, a job to pay all the bills, juggling childcare on your own, it can feel completely impossible.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead, take it one day at a time. Concentrate on getting your little one dressed and off to nursery, or on putting their dinner on the table. Wake up the next day and do the same. When you’re ready to start taking action on bigger things, break them down into daily, manageable tasks. Before you realise it, you’ll be in that place that you couldn’t imagine reaching, at the top of that mountain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">2 Ask for help</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And say yes when it is offered. If you have friends and family nearby, take them up on offers of help, dinners, babysitting... anything they’re sending your way. Finding your network of support is key to making it through those early days. I was so very lucky to have such understanding family and friends around, but if you don’t have any to hand, find your tribe online.

Learn to trust yourself in your parenting decisions, and eventually you’ll enjoy the freedom it brings you, and the confidence that flying solo brings.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Forgive yourself. Be patient. Be kind. You are doing the best you can"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">4 Go your own way</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Don’t let anybody tell you how you should or shouldn’t be coping, or what you should or shouldn’t be doing. If you want to stay in, concentrate solely on parenting and learn to crochet in the evenings after your son’s bedtime for six months and mostly ignore all your friends and family (guilty) then do that. You’ll go back outside eventually.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">5 Be patient</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No, not with the kids, but with yourself. You will make mistakes. You will have bad days. You will shout at the kids. You will feel lonely, remorseful, guilty, angry, the whole works. Forgive yourself. Be patient. Be kind. You are doing the best you can, and your children will benefit in so many ways from having the sole focus of your love and attention. They don’t need to see perfection, they need to see you doing your best.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">6 Get clued-up</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you can, do some reading and be informed on what rights you have and what resources are available to you. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Gingerbread class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gingerbread</a> is a charity for single parents with a wealth of information and advice to access. If you feel lost, it can help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">7 Turn to the magical little people</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Don’t feel like you have to be the strong one all the time. Allow your child(ren) to be your strength. When you’re flailing, focus on them. They will rescue you, time after time after time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Listen to the brand-new Frolo podcast <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-frolo-podcast/id1456164896?mt=2%EF%BB%BF" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=here data-vars-ga-product-id=0111e0f0-e988-4cd2-82db-6e8d1f36ed9c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-frolo-podcast/id1456164896?mt=2%EF%BB%BF" data-product-url="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-frolo-podcast/id1456164896?mt=2%EF%BB%BF" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-frolo-podcast%2Fid1456164896%3Fmt%3D2%EF%BB%BF" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5d7772a8-5f49-4998-93f3-aaf8cc9c4a07 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">here</a>.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhws9Sim55nkWeDeYWQcGpwZ6Oeu6i4xGanmqqVo8FurcOvoJydXZa7pXnHnqOpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
