The brand launched its first-ever "Haute Parfumerie" collection today, available on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.celine.com/en-us/celine-haute-parfumerie/haute-parfumerie-collection/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Celine.com " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Celine.com </a>and at the boutique on 650 Madison Avenue. Each of the 11 scents were inspired by memories from creative director Hedi Slimane's journal and curated under his artistic direction.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop the Collection<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scents are gender neutral and organized into daytime and nighttime fragrances, though there should be no rules around how you wear them. "By questioning for over more than 20 years the societal notion of gender in his collections and photographs, Hedi Slimane is closely and culturally associated with the advent of a masculine-feminine style in both fashion and photography and, more particularly, with an androgynous definition of masculinity," states a brand release. "Consequently, the Celine Haute Parfumerie collection recaptures the couturier’s stylistic codes."</p><img alt="Sculpture, Art, Classical sculpture, Black-and-white, Forehead, Interaction, Stock photography, Monochrome photography, Statue, Photography, " title="Sculpture, Art, Classical sculpture, Black-and-white, Forehead, Interaction, Stock photography, Monochrome photography, Statue, Photography, " width=768 height=768 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-11-04-at-9-51-21-am-1572879101.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Celine</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nine of the scents are available now, while two others (Bois Dormant and Rimbaud) will be available in 2020. The daytime scents are Parade, Saint-Germain-Des-Prés, Dans Paris, Cologne Française, La Peau Neue, Bois Dormant, Rimbaud, and Eau De Californie. The nighttime scents are Black Tie, Reptile, and Nightclubbing. Each scent is decidedly bold and unique, though if we had to choose one favorite, we're partial to Reptile. It has notes of white orris butter, cedar, tree moss, leather, and musk.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In conjunction with the launch, the brand has opened a stunning new boutique dedicated to the Haute Parfumerie collection at 390 Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris.</p><img alt="Building, Aisle, Interior design, Floor, Architecture, Furniture, Flooring, Inventory, Chair, " title="Building, Aisle, Interior design, Floor, Architecture, Furniture, Flooring, Inventory, Chair, " width=1792 height=1188 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-11-04-at-11-49-23-am-1572886175.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Celine</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn't the first fragrance launch for Celine or Slimane. The brand has had several fragrances over the years, starting with 1964's Vent Four, 1996's Magic for women, and a handful of perfumes and colognes in the early aughts. Slimane created three Maison Christian Dior perfumes in 2004 while serving as creative director for Dior Homme. This Haute Parfumerie collection, however, is deeply personal for Slimane, drawing from his time and memories in Paris and California.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each scent is priced at $220 for 100 ml and $320 for 200 ml. The collection is available to shop on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.celine.com/en-us/celine-haute-parfumerie/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Celine.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Celine.com</a> and at the 650 Madison Avenue boutique in New York.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppqaWuFd32TaWacnZyeu6Z5xauYoKqRo7CmecKoo6Wdk6m2sLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
