While wine will be free-flowing on Christmas Day, there's one thing the royals definitely won't be doing – getting drunk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/82713987ca37-king-charles-camilla-sandringham-church.jpg><p id=eyriAz5u1UZ data-wc=26><strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>spoke to former <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>royal butler Grant Harrold</a>, who told us "hand on heart" that the royals never get drunk at family gatherings, even at Christmas.</p><p id=eO89uqyeSc_ data-wc=40>"I can hand on heart say I have never ever seen a member of the royal family drunk. If we're talking about staff members, that's different ball game!," he said during a festive etiquette event hosted by Press Box PR.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">ROYAL TIPPLES</h4><p id=ep_IPpLLoLr data-wc=33>Royal etiquette expert Grant worked for King Charles from 2004 to 2011 when he was Prince of Wales and has spent time with Prince William, Princess Kate and Prince Harry over the years.</p><p id=eXZzVdhcBh data-wc=34>He added: "We used to go to Christmas parties which was hysterical really good fun, getting to sit at a table with Prince William and have a lunch was quite unusual, but good fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fb89e11211d8-kate-middleton-drinking-booze.jpg><p id=eQxmRvZbyvV data-wc=22>"But again, you never saw them drunk, even dare I say Harry, never in person. I’ve never seen any of them drunk."</p><h2>The royals' favourite Christmas tipples</h2><p id=e9NKmN8uDEN data-wc=54>That doesn't mean the royals don't enjoy a few wines with their roast turkey, stuffing and pigs in blankets, however. In fact, they have quite the selection of booze on offer on 25 December, the preference being Royal Warrant holder brands, such as Laurent-Perrier champagne, which is sold in the shop at Highgrove House.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8db9a232b2a1-king-charles-queen-camilla-drinking.jpg><p id=eEgU2zxTHZaV data-wc=40>"They always offered the white wines traditionally with the starter, then the red wines," Grant told us. "With the pudding course, what I also remember is that sometimes there would be a dessert wine or a rose or pink champagne."</p><p id=eSUgz8PdeaRo data-wc=32>It's a fact that the royals love a cheeky beverage – even if they do consume alcohol in moderation. The late Queen Elizabeth II was known to <a class=hm-link href=#>enjoy a gin and Dubonnet</a>.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Royal Christmas food schedule</h3><ul><li>Breakfast – Fry up for the men, lighter options for the women</li><li>11 AM – Tea and coffee served with biscuits</li><li>12.30 – Pre-lunch drinks</li><li>1-3 PM – Christmas lunch – roast turkey with all the trimmings</li><li>4-6 PM – Afternoon tea</li><li>6.30-7 PM – Pre-evening drinks</li><li>7-8 PM – Pre-dinner drinks</li><li>8-10 PM – Dinner</li><li>10-midnight - Optional supper</li></ul><p id=eUUX1wPCfPLU data-wc=56>Former royal chef Darren McGrady previously debunked rumours that Her Late Majesty drank four cocktails a day. He told CNN: "She'd be pickled if she drank that much. All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favourite drink… She doesn't wake up in the morning and have a large gin and tonic."</p><p id=eKZpRX_nYn data-wc=41>As for Princess Kate, the royal mum and her husband Prince William are both known to love a pint, whether it's Guinness or lager on tap during official engagements.
