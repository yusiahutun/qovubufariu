Jenner came across a documentary on renowned Victoria's Secret photographer, Russell James, whom she called "the guy who could really discover VS models." When she got home, she researched him, somehow found his phone number, and left him a voicemail where she told him about Kendall and asked to meet with him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eventually, James did call her back. Kris and the family were having lunch with her mother in San Diego—while filming Keeping Up with the Kardashians, no less—when the photographer returned her call. "This is Russell James and I would love to meet your daughter," Jenner recalled him saying on the phone. They set up a meeting with him and Kendall 10 days later at their house.</p><img alt="kendall jenner" title="kendall jenner " width=2000 height=3001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kendall-vs-626762806-1508952439.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Jenner walking the VS Fashion Show in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I said to Kendall, look, go upstairs and put on your cutest party dress," Kris remembered telling her daughter. "Brush your hair, put on your party shoes, and when he gets here, come downstairs." Kendall ultimately wore platform shoes, skinny jeans, and a cute top, but she made an impression on James nonetheless. "He said, 'You're right, she's beautiful, and I can't wait to work with her,'" Jenner said.
