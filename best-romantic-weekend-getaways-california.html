This historical oceanfront property is the ultimate luxury experience, and the perfect getaway experience if you’re looking for a romantic space to unwind, enjoy the scenery (you can’t get much better than the Pacific), and take in the beauty of Coronado.<p>One important note is that The Del is very popular in the spring and summer months — we’d recommend booking your trip in advance (or being okay with visiting off-season: Former San Diegan editor here: October is actually still a great month to visit, since it’s still fairly warm in SD, but not as crowded with tourists. You’ll get seated at restaurants far quicker, and the beaches won’t be so jam-packed. You’re welcome!).</p><p><strong>Average cost:</strong> $280+ per night<br><strong>What’s Around?</strong> Coronado is its own isolated little “island,” and its surrounding areas have restaurants, cafes, and bars. You’re surrounded by ocean, so this is a popular activity for most staying here. Feel like exploring San Diego? You’re about 15 minutes away from Downtown, and a short distance from beach cities like Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, and Mission Beach.<br><strong>Adults only or kid friendly:</strong> Kid friendly<br><strong>Restaurant offerings</strong>: 7 restaurants<br><strong>Amenities (pool, spa, etc.):</strong> one pool, fitness center, direct beach access (and cabana offerings)</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
