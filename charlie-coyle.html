Originally from Massachusetts, Charlie played for his high school team, the Wildcat varsity, during his freshman year.</p><p>During that time, through his help, the team made their first-ever MIAA appearance, played at the TD Garden against a private school, Boston College High School.</p><p>Likewise, the Wildcat Varsity came out as an underdog beating notable private schools like Maiden Catholic High School, Austin Preparatory School, and Central Catholic High School.</p><p>Before completing his senior year, Coyle also played for Thayer Academy in Braintree.</p><p>He then went on and played with the South Shore Kings against Tier III Junior A Ice hockey in the Eastern Junior Hockey League(EJHL).</p><p>During his first and only season, Charlie finished fifth overall, where he scored 63 points in 42 games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charlie-002.jpg><p>After playing for various teams, young Coyle finally settled with NCAA Division I College ice hockey with the Boston University Terriers of the Hockey East for the 2010-11 season.</p><p>In their first game, Coyle scored two assists and finished the season with 26 points in a total of 37 regular games.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, Charlie finally decided to leave Boston University and joined Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League(QMJHL) on December 16, 2011.</p><h2>What position does Charlie Coyle play?- NHL</h2><p>The young talent, Charlie Coyle, came into the NHL professional league after being drafted in the first round, 28th overall at the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.</p><p>But San Jose Sharks later traded him to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for Brent Burns and a second-round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft; and a first-round pick in the 2011 Draft.</p><p>Likewise, on March 1, 2012, Charlie signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Wild.
