The network is home to some of the most exciting renovation shows like </span><a href=#><i><span>Home Town</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rock the Bloc</span></i><span>k, </span><i><span>Fixer to Fabulous</span></i><span> and more. It’s no surprise that </span><a href=#><b>Erin Napier</b></a><span>, </span><a href=#><b>Jenny Marrs</b></a><span>,</span><b> Hilary Farr </b><span>and other design experts have amassed incredible <a href=#>net worths</a> since stepping into the spotlight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Erin and her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Ben Napier</b></a><span>, are two of the most recognizable faces on HGTV. The pair have won over viewers with their charm, dedication to raising <a href=#>their two daughters</a> and overall zeal toward their projects. In addition to earning a salary from </span><i><span>Home Town</span></i><span>, they lead several spinoff shows including </span><i><span>Home Town Takeover</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Home Town: Ben’s Workshop</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even after building their home improvement empire, the duo are still shocked that they landed on television for the first time back in 2016.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The way it all happened was crazy,” Ben told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in April 2020. “It was never something we thought would turn into a career.”</span></p><p><span>Power couples often pave their way to success on HGTV. Jenny and her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Dave Marrs</b></a><span>, expanded their business after landing </span><i><span>Fixer to Fabulous</span></i><span> in 2019. The pair released their own outdoor furniture collection at Walmart. In July 2022, they announced that they would be a part of season 2 of </span><i><span>Home Town Takeover</span></i><span> with Erin and Ben.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I believe this show is going to be a bright light of hope and we are immensely honored to have been asked to partner with the Napiers to transform this town!” Jenny wrote on Instagram at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And while some stars might be newer to HGTV, others have long established themselves in the design and real estate circuits. Hilary has been a respected designer in the U.S., Canada and Europe for decades. Similarly, </span><a href=#><b>Ty Pennington</b></a><span>‘s big break came when he was a carpenter on </span><i><span>Trading Spaces</span></i><span> on TLC in 2000. Three years later, he began hosting </span><i><span>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>Extreme Makeover</span></i><span> was such a big show. We did over 224 homes for 10 years, so there really wasn’t a day off,” the Georgia native told TV Insider in December 2020. “I had to step away from TV for a little bit and focus on just being Ty. I built my own house, looked after my mom, and spent time with the family … I just wanted to wait for the right project that made sense.”</span></p><p><span>With a long list of incredible achievements on television, Ty’s net worth has grown to new heights. In 2021, the first season of his show </span><i><span>Ty Breaker </span></i><span>debuted on HGTV. The Georgia native also hosted the second and third seasons of </span><i><span>Rock the Block</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see the net worths of your favorite HGTV stars.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnq2uXajBor7SZqWerF2svLPAx6xkoaenYrq2r8dmpKimla56pbuMrZ%2BesV2irqyxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
