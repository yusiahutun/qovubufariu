It comes after his album from the band, Bleachers, and Ye’s upcoming record are set to be released on the same day.</strong></p><p>He took aim at Ye – as he is now known – on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, which was liked more than 40,000 times and re-tweeted 2,000. The singer-songwriter has also collaborated with other pop icons like Lorde and Lana Del Rey. But he’s also known for working with music star <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. He performs as the lead singer of the Bleachers, who are set to release their self-titled album on March 8, the same day as <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. The rapper is set to make a showbiz comeback, dropping the second part of his Vultures trilogy with Ty Dolla Sign.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-antonoff-calling-out-kanye-west-backfires>Jack Antonoff calling out Kanye West backfires</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1938441811-753x1024.jpg><p>Sometimes, having albums release the same day can be a big deal in the industry. It can cause fans who like both artists within a same genre to lean on one more than the other, harming chart positions and sales.</p><p>However, Jack Antonoff and Kanye West aren’t exactly the same genre, so they shouldn’t face much competition. There may be some listeners who are a fan of both, which is why the <a href=#>music</a> producer apparently called him out.</p><p>He blasted Ye, poking fun at the ‘hilarious’ decision to release a track on the same date.</p><p>Jack wrote on Twitter: “Kanye on bleachers release date is hilarious little cry baby b****”.</p><p>Although, when it was shared to other popular news and music accounts, it became awkward. A lot of users claimed they’ve never heard of Jack Antonoff, but know who Kanye West is – so who won this battle?</p><p>One person wrote: “Who TF is Jack Antonoff?”</p><p>A second added: “No one knows you bro cut it out”.</p><p>And someone else echoed: “What the hell is a Bleachers”.</p><p>Yikes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-antonoff-has-worked-with-taylor-swift-on-multiple-albums>Jack Antonoff has worked with Taylor Swift on multiple albums</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1463288523-1024x683.jpg><p>The producer worked with Swift for her albums 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore and Evermore.</p><p>What makes it extra spicy is how <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Kanye West</a> had their own beef from years ago. At the <a href=#>MTV Music Video Awards</a> in 2009, he stormed the stage and snatched the mic from her hands. He then declared to the room full of <a href=#>celebrities</a> – and the world – that Beyoncé should have won the gong for Best Video by a Female Artist, not Taylor.</p><p>After that, there was another drama, where Ye rapped about Taylor in his song Famous. He raps: “I feel like me and Taylor still might have sex / Why? I made that b***h famous.”</p><p>When it came out, it caused an uproar with her fans. Kim Kardashian later released a video, allegedly edited, that appears to show Ye calling Swift up to seek approval of the line. But it doesn’t show the entire conversation, nor Ye asking if he can refer to the singer as ‘b***h’.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-finally-spoke-out-over-that-song>Taylor finally spoke out over THAT song</h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116>However, she did release a statement on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> after, finally responding to the lyrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116>She said at the time: “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that b***h’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-118>“Of course, I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-118>“While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120>“I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,” Swift wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120>She captioned the post: “That moment when&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Kanye West</a>&nbsp;secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.”</p><p>The rest is purely Reputation and history.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eCcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkqaqfmcKksdFmoZqbm2Kur8DOp6afnl2Yrq240maimqapmnq4sdKtZJplk6fGbq7Am7Bmp6aav26ty5uspmWToa60tI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
