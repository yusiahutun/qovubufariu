Of course, if you prefer $69, we will not stop you â€” or judge you!," she continued. "No matter the amount, you deserve to spoil your dog with our shop's best-selling toys, gifts, home essentials, and more."</p><p>While labeling this a judgement-free zone, Milberg-Jones was also sure to offer a (mock?) explanation of exactly how the ad came to be -- claiming she was blissfully unaware of the connotation behind the number 69 before googling it herself -- ON HER WORK COMPUTER.</p><p class=quote-block__text>Unfortunately, I used my work laptop and now have to take HR seminars (that I designed) because I inadvertently violated BARK's HR policy (that I created). Not to mention I am now getting served all SORTS of ads and BARK has an open office plan.</p><p>"To clarify, $69 was a random number that our strategy team landed on. However, after seeing the distress the email caused, I Googled '69' and immediately realized this number has other meanings. As an aside, if you search '69' online, I suggest you do so in an 'incognito window,'" Milberg-Jones hilariously said before claiming she now will have to take the company's HR seminars -- which she designed -- after viewing NSFW content on her company computer. "Unfortunately, I used my work laptop and now have to take HR seminars (that I designed) because I inadvertently violated BARK's HR policy (that I created). Not to mention I am now getting served all SORTS of ads and BARK has an open office plan."</p><p>"Once again, our apologies for any misunderstanding. Our aim is to satisfy our customers and celebrate whatever they may (or may not) be into," she added, concluding the apology email.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:33872f3b-f354-4aac-a809-fdc93e68166d data-container-ref=toofab:article:7cd4bab9-4dc2-4a66-b05e-6df8cb51ce9b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/55/5by4/2024/02/09/555f52ccc46e412582745937217859e0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">WTAE</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Parents Arrested In 'Torture' of 6-Year-Old Girl Kept Naked In Dog Cage, Zip-Tied & Shot with BB Gun: Authorities</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>This apology is not too far off from what Bark has done in the past when sharing controversial ads and products.
