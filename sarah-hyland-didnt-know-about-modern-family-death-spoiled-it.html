The news followed his fears that Frank had developed dementia. “When I was growing up, he was the cool dad,” Phil recalled of his final encounter with his dad. “He was hip. He knew all the dances from&nbsp;Grease. He knew all the expressions. BFF: best friends forever, TMI: too much information, BJ: blue jeans. We didn’t do much that day, but it might have been one of the best days I’ve ever had with my dad. I just didn’t know it would be the last.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sarah-Hyland-Didnt-Know-About-Modern-Family-Death-02.jpg><p>The series has not been afraid to <a href=#>kill off significant characters</a> in the&nbsp;leadup&nbsp;to its series finale. Claire (<a href=#><strong>Julie Bowen</strong></a>) and Mitchell’s (<a href=#><strong>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</strong></a>) mother, DeDe (<strong><a href=#>Shelley Long</a></strong>), <a href=#>died during a season 10 episode</a> that aired in October 2018.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It occurred to us that death is a giant part of the family experience and while Phil had lost his mother in a previous episode, we’ve never seen the entire family have to deal with such a loss. It seemed like an interesting thing to have happen,”&nbsp;cocreator&nbsp;<strong>Steve Levitan</strong> told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;at the time. “She’s directly involved with three of our characters and she touched everybody’s life in some interesting way. It seemed like the right character to put everybody through something. She seemed like the right character because she so directly affects so many of our characters.”</p><p>Modern Family&nbsp;airs on ABC Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqaqpGdeqnFy5qlnWWUnrGvwIykpaivXZavsMHTZqSonJWnu26ywKagpbFdmbKiwMdmqqmnmaGypXnIrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
