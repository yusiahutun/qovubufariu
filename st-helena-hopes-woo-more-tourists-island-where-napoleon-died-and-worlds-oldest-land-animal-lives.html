British Georgian-era colonial buildings house small retail and grocery stores. There are a couple of DVD rental shops – remnants of the time before the island had high-speed internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For a workout with a view, climb the 699 steps of Jacob’s Ladder, on the edge of the city. The outdoor staircase that ascends 180 metres (600ft) was originally a track for carts pulled by donkeys, used to transport goods between the city and fortifications on the cliffs above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/25/1d6c9b78-fad7-4ac0-a1bb-ef83d3f31fad_2ba58e94.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plantation House, 3.5km south of the capital, is a grand Georgian mansion built in 1792 by the British East India Company, which administered St Helena until 1834.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now the governor’s official residence, the house features a collection of royal portraits and original furnishings, including antique china and a chandelier from Bonaparte’s final home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plantation House’s well-manicured garden is home to one of the island’s most famous residents, a venerable tortoise named Jonathan. With an approximate age of 192, Jonathan holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living land animal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Jonathan is an enigmatic tortoise,” says Teeny Lucy, his caretaker for over a decade. “If you come to St Helena, people usually know two things: Jonathan the tortoise and Napoleon Bonaparte.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jonathan has lost his sight and sense of smell, but remains a major draw for tourists like Gilly Hill, who travelled from Britain to snap selfies with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I just think he’s the most amazing creature,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/25/ca725bc0-7c30-4cfd-9d8c-6816bedcf958_f2112c18.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other activities include swimming with Chilean devil rays or whale sharks, which are often spotted between December and March. There’s also humpback whale watching, from June to December.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Come in January to catch peak nesting season for the wirebird, also known as the St Helena plover, which can only be found on this island. It is one of more than 500 species are not seen anywhere else on Earth, including 45 flowering plants and ferns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Microclimates that range from cool tropical forest to sunny rolling grassland and windswept volcanic cliffs can all be experienced within an hour’s drive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/25/8499f4b1-bc9f-4084-9802-657284fd3740_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With two dozen scenic trails to choose from, serious trekkers might head for the highest point, Diana’s Peak. The 3.7km hike takes you 820 metres above sea level and into Britain’s last remaining natural cloud forest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Casual hikers can stroll along Blue Point Trail for views of Sandy Bay, Sperry Island and Castle Rock. For a moderate challenge, try the shaded hike to the Heart Shaped Waterfall, which flows only in winter and early spring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perched at 520 metres on one of the lushest and most remote parts of the island is a historic estate with sweeping cloud-forest views: Wranghams is a small coffee farm with tours and home stays, run by Neil and Debbie Fantom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/25/6974ee83-73bf-4edc-bb30-e4299bb1f821_2ba58e94.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coffee connoisseurs seek out St Helena’s beans, often touted as one of the rarest and most expensive varieties in the world because of their export costs and single-origin status. The coffee sells online for US$150 per 227 grams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Extreme isolation has ensured that the coffee plants, which were imported from Yemen in the 18th century, have never been cross-fertilised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Is it the best in the world? I couldn’t tell you. Is it coffee that we enjoy producing and drinking? One hundred per cent,” Neil says. “We’ve got the perfect climate for it, and we do it ourselves.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other local culinary delights include plo, a cross between curry and Spanish paella; fresh fishcakes; and sponge cakes with bright pink icing known as coconut fingers.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Know before you go</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Money</strong>: St Helena has no ATMs, credit cards are not widely accepted, and the local bank has limited hours. Be sure to bring British pounds to cover your stay and the £20 entry fee (about US$25). Another option is St Helena Bank’s prepaid Tourist Card app, which can be loaded with debit cards online and is accepted throughout the island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Connectivity</strong>: download essentials like the Tourist Card app and offline Google maps before you arrive, as Wi-fi and mobile data is limited and expensive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/25/c5357092-7b8f-4b0b-97b6-712a2bb78f50_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Getting there</strong>: Airlink flies once weekly from Johannesburg, South Africa. A midweek flight is often added during the busier summer season, December to March. You’ll need proof of medical insurance covering at least £175,000 to board the plane.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Where to stay</strong>: accommodation ranges from simple homestays to boutique hotels. The higher-end Mantis St Helena has 30 rooms and complimentary, reliable internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Getting around</strong>: St Helena’s narrow roads and blind curves are not for the faint of heart. If you’re comfortable driving manual cars on the left hand side of the road, rentals are available. Otherwise, taxis are your best option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtsb21mbHy0wIyhnKWdnpZ6qbvPnqpmr5%2Bkeq670Z5kraelp7a0wNJmoKykkaOxbsPHnqmeZZ6WvbC4xKilZpyZmrFurc2dZLCnoqGxtHnOpZueq6RiuaK6w2aYp6GdlrluuMivnKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
