(@DJQUICKSILVA) <a href=#>December 24, 2023</a></p><p>On August 10, 2022, <a class=underline-link href=#>Angela Yee announced on-air her impending exit from the popular Power 105.1 show,</a> while revealing she’ll be hosting her very own nationally syndicated daily show on iHeartRadio.</p><p>“This is something that I’ve been wanting to do for years now, since way before the pandemic,” Yee began. “I had actually sat down with our big boss, Thea [Mitchem], and I was telling her, ‘Look, I really want to have my own show.’</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“You know I have my podcast,&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Lip Service</a>, and I was thinking I would be able to get something like a weekend situation. You know, one day ease into having my own show again; I did come from Sirius where I had&nbsp;The Morning After with Angela Yee, and then came here.”</p><p>She added: “So it’s always been a goal of mine to have that. And so I thought that I would still be on here and then do that show as well. But years later, they approached me up here at iHeart, Thea had a sit down with me, and told me that they’re gonna give me my very own show!</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I wasn’t sure what was happening when she first told me, but I am going to be leaving&nbsp;The Breakfast Club. You guys, obviously, will continue on and it’ll be a different iteration of&nbsp;The Breakfast Club, but I will have my own show up here at iHeart as well, so I’ll be part of the family.”</p><p>Despite seeming to leave the show on good terms, rumors persisted about Yee’s departure being for a more salacious reason — <a class=underline-link href=#>a claim The Breakfast Club co-host Charlamagne Tha God flatly denied in a May 2023 interview.</a></p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/angela-feels-she-was-criticized-more-than-charlamagne-the-god-on-the-breakfast-club-250x142.png alt="Angela Yee Feels She Was Criticized More Than Charlamagne Tha God On ‘The Breakfast Club’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Angela Yee Feels She Was Criticized More Than Charlamagne Tha God On ‘The Breakfast Club’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 2, 2023</p></a><p>“I think people want it to be something salacious, but it’s not,” Charlamagne said. “She left&nbsp;Breakfast Club&nbsp;because she got the opportunity to do her own nationally syndicated show.&nbsp;Way Up With Angela Yee&nbsp;is a nationally syndicated show it comes on 10 am to 2pm right after&nbsp;The Breakfast Club, and I think that would be hard for anybody to pass up … Angela Yee never got the opportunity to host her own show on terrestrial radio.”</p><p>He went on to say that Yee was the only one out of the&nbsp;BC&nbsp;trio that never got the opportunity to host her own morning show and that the chance for her to do so was long overdue.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“It’s kinda hard to pass up the opportunity to be the only syndicated Black woman at iHeart,” Charlamagne said. “I think that’s a great opportunity why not take it? And when you been doing the same thing for 13 years everybody don’t have the same way of doing things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miroZ1dl7%2BmrcqfmKysXZi5tq6MqZyrpZGjsq%2FAjJymZqCfqMFurc2gnKWZXa6ypg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
