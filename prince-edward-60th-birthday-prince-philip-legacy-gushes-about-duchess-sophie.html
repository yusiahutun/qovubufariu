The prince’s many years have undoubtedly given way to new experiences and great wisdom, some of which he reflected on while appearing on Love Your Weekend With Alan Titchmarsh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On this day, the prince remembered the legacy of his late father, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29748471/prince-philip-title-not-king/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Philip" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Prince Philip</u></a>. Edward looked back on his last birthday when his brother <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46939226/king-charles-iii-smiles-get-well-cards-cancer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King Charles III" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>King Charles III</u></a> gifted him a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43272111/prince-edward-sophie-duke-duchess-edinburgh/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="new title" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>new title</u></a>: The Duke of Edinburgh, which Philip held before him. “It was a huge privilege but also quite a lot of weight of expectation as well,” he told Titchmarsh. “I mean, there's an awful lot of legacy that came with that title and everything that my father had done.”</p><img alt="the countess of wessex diamond challenge" title="The Countess Of Wessex - Diamond Challenge" width=1843 height=1325 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh-and-prince-edward-earl-of-news-photo-1710075677.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Philip’s legacy is something Edward finds “impossible” to describe. “He was just an extraordinary man. He was the Prince Albert of our age,” he said. The Duke of Edinburgh recalled his father’s love for design and innovation, his encouraging spirit, and the lasting effect he has had on Edward’s children. He specifically thought back on the time Philip taught his daughter Lady Louis Windsor how to drive a carriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The prince’s birthday is especially special this year as it coincides with Mothering Sunday (U.K. Mother’s Day). He said the holiday was always important growing up and is “doubly so” now that he has his own children.</p><img alt="london, england october 01 prince edward, earl of wessex and sophie, countess of wessex during their visit to vauxhall city farm on october 01, 2020 in london, england their royal highnesses will see the farms community engagement and education programmes in action, as the farm marks the start of black history month photo by chris jackson wpa poolgetty images" title="The Earl And Countess Of Wessex Visit Vauxhall City Farm" width=5000 height=3283 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1277767373-65eda993db808.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Those days were, and these days are really important to remember some very, very special people in our lives,” he said during the interview. “There should be several times in the year when we make a special sort of effort and Mothering Sunday was very much one of those where you made a special effort just to say ‘thank you’.
