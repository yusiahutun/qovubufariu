She graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1934 with a degree in history and worked as a copywriter in the advertising department of W. & J. Sloane after college. During World War II, Child joined the Office of Strategic Services after she learned that she was too tall to enlist in the army or navy. She started her OSS career as a typist before she was promoted to a researcher working on top-secret projects. Child’s job with the OSS took her around the world to places like Kandy, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she met her husband, Paul Cushing Child, who was also an OSS employee. The couple married in 1946 and moved to Paris, France, in 1948 after the OSS assigned Paul there as an officer with the United States Information Agency.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>While in Paris, Child discovered her love of French cuisine and enrolled at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. She graduated from the school in 1951 and went to study under master chefs like Max Bugnard. She also joined the women’s cooking club, Le Cercle des Gourmettes, where she met cookbook author Simone Beck, who proposed that Child also write a French cookbook for Americans. In 1961, Child published her first cookbook, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>, with The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. The book, which was 726 pages, was a critical and commercial success and led Child to her first cooking show, The French Chef, in 1963. The show, which is seen as one of the first cooking hows on American television, skyrocketed Child’s career, which included dozens of more cookbooks and cooking hows before her death in 2004.</p><p>Child died of kidney failure on August 13, 2004, in Montecito, California.

Mastering the Art of French Cooking was Child’s first cookbook and was published in 1961 by Knopf. A second volume of the book—which sought to introduce French cuisine to American audiences—was published in 1970. Despite its relative expensive cost at $10 in 1965, the first volume of Mastering the Art of French Cooking was a commercial success and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first five years. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Meal</a>, Mastering the Art of French Cooking sold around 4,000 copies each month by the end of 1964 and sold more than 600,000 copies by 1969. As of 2011, the cookbook has sold more than 1.5 million copies, making it one of the most successful cookbooks in history. While it’s unclear how much Child made from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, the book still made a lot more than what Alfred Knopf, the founder of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, expected it to make. According to The Daily Meal, Knopf invested little money into promoting the book and told publishers, “Well, I’ll eat my hat if that title sells.”</p><h2>How much did Julia Child make on The French Chef?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Julia-Child-1.jpg><p>How much did Julia Child make on The French Chef? Child hosted The French Chef for 10 seasons from 1963 to 1973. She first filmed the pilot in 1962 before the show was picked up as a weekly series for&nbsp;WGBH, a public television station in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1963. The show saw Child make recipes from her 1961 cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which debuted two years before The French Chef‘s premiere and released a second volume in 1970. Each episode was filmed live-to-videotape, with few to no edits, which led to many on-screen cooking accidents by Child who would use them as “teachable moments” for viewers.</p><p>The French Chef<span> aired for 216 28-minute episodes and won a Primetime Emmy Award in the Achievements in Educational Television – Individuals category in 1966. The show, which seen as one of the first cooking shows on American television, is also credited for introducing French cuisine to the American public at a time when it was considered expensive restaurant fare and not suitable for home cooking. Reruns of The French Chef continue to air on networks like PBS and Cooking Channel.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So…how much did Julia Child make on The French Chef? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Buffalo News</a>, Child make just $50 per episode for the first season of The French Chef in 1963, which equals to around $450 today. She also had to pay for the cost of the food for each episode, as well as clean up her own kitchen, which was used as the set. Her husband, Paul Cushing Child, did most of the cleanup, however. Child’s pay is a lot different than cooking show hosts today. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Guy Fieri signed a three-year deal with Food Network for $80 million in 2021. The magazine also reported that Rachael Ray made around $25 million per year from her businesses, which included her talk show, Rachael Ray, and her Food Network show, 30 Minute Meals. Emeril Lagasse, who hosted shows like Emeril Live and Essence of Emeril, also made $8 million per year, according to Forbes.</p><h2>What was Julia Child’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Julia-Child-2.jpg><p>What was Julia Child’s net worth before her death in 2004?
