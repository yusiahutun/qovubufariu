I love it,” Annie exclusively told Closer Weekly — in the magazine’s latest issue, on newsstands now! — of her youthful vibe. “I’m in constant motion, and I like it that way.”</p><p>Indeed, she’s rarely been off the screen since she nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for Best New Female Star of the Year with her first film, 1978’s Corvette Summer. She went on to star in Ghostbusters, Love & War (which earned her an Emmy nom), and to voice Bo Peep in Toy Story, which returns with another sequel next summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/designing-women.jpg><p>There would have been even more roles if it hadn’t been for her “three great boys” — sons Clay, 37, Doc, 26, and Harry, 22. “I’d been doing series and movies on my hiatuses and found it wasn’t good for the children, and I was exhausting myself,” she revealed. “I don’t regret [slowing down], because I got more time with them.”</p><p>Today, her primary home is&nbsp;in New Orleans, where her husband of 28 years, James Hayman, executive-produces NCIS: New Orleans. Now Annie opens up to Closer about blending her family, the Designing Women sequel, and much more — <strong>scroll down to read our exclusive Q&A with Annie!&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Congrats on Young Sheldon! How’d you get involved with the show?</h2><p>When they asked me to join, they already had that beautiful pilot. [Creators] Chuck Lorre and Steve Molaro have a fabulous track record, so when I saw it, I went, “Yeah, I want that!”</p><h2>It’s one of your funniest roles. Where does your great chemistry with 10-year-old Iain Armitage (Sheldon) come from?</h2><p>I had moved away from LA and came back and was renting a house not far from where&nbsp;he and his mom were renting a house. They were new in town and we ended up spending a lot of time together. I love them personally, but of course, it wonderfully benefited the work. That was a super-happy thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/young-sheldon.jpg><h2>It was great to hear about the Designing Women sequel coming to ABC and that you’d like to be part of it. Any new news?</h2><p>There’s talk that they want me to be a part of it as much as I [am able to] with Young Sheldon. I’d like to in my time off. We’re in conversation about it now, but it’s just that: a conversation. It’s early in the development and just depends on the availability and selectability of other shows [we’re on]. Jean [Smart] has another show, too. But I know that [series co-creator] Linda [Bloodworth-Thomason] would very much like us to be in some part of it.</p><h2>What’s it like when you women reunite?</h2><p>We haven’t seen each other in a couple years now [since] I moved to New Orleans. Jean has this annual Christmas party and we usually see each other then.</p><h2>Can you take us back to the days on the set? What was it like?</h2><p>It was great. It was all women, a brilliant foursome, and we had a brilliant writer who wrote topical things from a woman’s point of view. We didn’t know how groundbreaking it was. I think if you put that same show on now, it would be so explosive they’d probably try to shut us down! It was a lot of fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-72268485.jpg><h2>And how was filming Ghostbusters?</h2><p>Oh, wild. It was so much fun. I mean really, really fun. All of the actors came from improv, and I didn’t. The script was great, and I didn’t understand why they needed to not adhere to it. But they were used to being inventive and just playing, so I had to figure out how to get down with that groove.</p><h2>You went back and forth from film to TV effortlessly when not many actors were.</h2><p>It’s different these days, no one thinks about it. Thirty years ago, you either did TV or you didn’t. I needed to pay the mortgage, so I did whatever I needed to do.</p><h2>How could you juggle such a demanding career and be there for your three sons?</h2><p>They were very understanding of my work. I also had lots of help raising them, a bevy of women who loved my boys. I had nannies, too. Once [the boys] got to a certain age, they benefitted from having guys around to be tough with them. Like every other woman in every other job, I just did the best I could and got lucky. They turned out great.</p><h2>You’ve been married to your fourth husband, James Hayman, since 1990. How did you know he was the one?</h2><p>Because right away he loved my son. I had an eight-year-old [Clay, with third husband B. Scott Senechal] when I met him. When you fall in love with somebody who comes into your surroundings when you have a kid already,&nbsp;[they] have to love both of us. He was so willing to do that. We were instantly a family, had two more sons together and a very happy life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-156112116.jpg><h2>What made you want to give marriage a fourth shot?</h2><p>Because I grew up in a family, I always wanted that experience for my children, too. I felt there was balance in that. When you have family, you seek a harmony that’s beneficial to everyone. By the time I met Jim, I was very successful in my career and successfully mothering as a single mom. [I thought,] I don’t need you, but this might be fun. I’ve always been practical.</p><h2>Are there benefits to your life today?</h2><p>I think it cuts both ways. When you get older, you lose some currency. It helps to have a hit show, so it looks like you’re still in the game. I also think there’s some wisdom. I’ve seen a lot. Besides rooms for my children, I’ve always had spare ones in my house that I try to fill with young people who need support — sometimes emotionally, sometimes financially. A little artist residency program.</p><h2>What’s next for you?</h2><p>I serve as an aunt and protector to quite a few, but I’m hoping to have grandchildren. My older son just got married, so I’m quite ready!</p><p><i>For more on Annie Potts, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to&nbsp;<a id=LPlnk338360 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>sign up for our newsletter</a></i><i>&nbsp;for more exclusive news!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apaehlWK9sMDTrGSdoZRiwamxjJucrKxdqbWiwIysn55lk6TCrbCMraZmoqWctK2xjKGcq2WWlrqquNhmmKecXZius7HEq2SesJOhwrS11Z5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
