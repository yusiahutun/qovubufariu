Which is why, I figured out how to end the wait: Wear your swimsuits to work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's right—I wore my favorite one-piece bathing suits to the office, pretending they were body suits, every day for a week. And despite numerous wedgies (and, let's be real, annoying bathroom visits), I can definitively say that it's not only possible, it's also great way to give your swim collection more love throughout the year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to my obsession with swimsuits, I had quite a few options stashed away—but choosing which ones were work appropriate was a whole different battle. On the NO list were any suits with very low-cut backs, straps that were too skinny, or out-or-control cleavage, which means I immediately nixed about half of my swim closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I realized that the key to making your one-piece wearable at work is balance, when it comes to both colors and silhouettes. I generally opt for bright hues, interesting silhouettes, and maybe a print here and there when I shop for swimsuits. To make them work, I complemented those look-at-me swim numbers with simple, monochrome bottoms and jackets. As you'll see in the video above, I paired my statement, color-blocked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Flagpole Swimsuit</a> with a simple denim flared skirt. On the other hand, when I wanted to wear statement clothing, I worked in a classic swim shape with a subtle, neutral print that functioned more or less like a tank.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rule #2, I found out, was wearing bottoms that don't encourage your suit to ride up (because there will be wedgies). A form-fitting pair of high-waisted jeans brought my wedgie count up to 10, but my denim skirt allowed me to sit in my bathing suit in peace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watch the video at top for more tried and true styling tips. Those swimsuits don’t have to gather dust in your closet for eight months! Break them out with your favorite midi skirt or underneath your chicest blazer for the office. It's swimsuit season—even if yours is making its debut at your desk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeYpMRuwM5mrp6ZomKubq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102arqGWnpL%2Bs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
