A few days later, after filming for The Fate of the Furious wrapped, Johnson posted another Instagram <a href=#>thanking some of his castmates</a> by name — <a href=#><strong>Scott Eastwood</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nathalie Emmanuel</strong></a>, for example — but pointedly did not mention Diesel.</p><p>Though the Rampage star never identified the target of his ire, his costar seemingly confirmed that it was him in his own Instagram video. “Honestly, give me a second and I will tell you everything,” he said. “Everything.”</p><p>Later, the duo’s costar <a href=#><strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong></a> confirmed that <a href=#>there was tension between the men</a> on set, though chalked it up as the kind of disagreement any close friends could have.</p><p>“Any human being who knows what men are like knows to stay out [of those] situations and let them figure it out,” she said in September 2016. “They’re ‘bros’, man. They’re friends, and ultimately even friends reach a point where they have to set aside their differences to make a movie for multicultural people around the world, and that is the bigger scheme of things.”</p><p>Fellow Fast Saga actor <strong><a href=#>Tyrese Gibson</a></strong> was somewhat less diplomatic, however, when F9 was delayed for the first time in October 2017. (It was later delayed again because of the coronavirus pandemic.)</p><p>“Congratulations to @TheRock and your brother in law aka 7 bucks producing partner @hhgarcia41 for making the fast and the furious franchise about YOU,” <a href=#>he wrote via Instagram</a>, seemingly blaming Johnson for the movie’s production delays.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At that point, Diesel <a href=#>defended the San Andreas actor</a> from Gibson’s accusations, saying that it wasn’t any one person’s fault and the franchise was “in need of maintenance.” Johnson, meanwhile, left the main Fast Saga and starred in his own spinoff, Hobbs & Shaw.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everything Hobbs and Toretto have said about their feud over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkw6q6jJ2gnquVoXqlw8CypZ5lpJ2ybr7OnKJmop%2Bdu7S7zWadnq2UYsGqucSloKedXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
