Patricia Molly Clapton and Edward Walter Fryer gave birth to her father. Her birth resulted from her father’s extramarital romance with recording studio manager Kelly. Ruth’s father was still married to Pattie Boyd at the time. Her parents never got married.</p><h2>Her Husband and Her Married Life</h2><p>Dean Bartlett, her long-term lover, is blissfully married to her. After dating for a few years, the couple exchanged wedding vows. The wedding took place in Ripley’s St. Mary Magdalen Church. Close friends and relatives attended it. Here’s a photo from their wedding day with the caption: “It was the happiest day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ruth-Clapton-1.jpg><p>She was stunning in a white strapless flower-printed gown. Dean donned a grey suit with a white rose tucked inside the coat.&nbsp;As they clutched one other’s hands, the pair looked stunning.&nbsp;Every year on September 10, the couple celebrates their anniversary.</p><h2>Mother of two kids</h2><p>She and her spouse have two children. In 2013, they had their first child, Isaac Eric Owen. The couple blessed another bundle of joy in March 2016. They named their son Theodore Ivan Bartlett.</p><h2>She has lost contact with her father.</h2><p>Eric’s daughter made headlines when she attended the burial of her half-brother, Conor Clapton (kid of Eric and Lory Del Santo), who died after falling from the 53rd floor of an apartment building.&nbsp;Ruth was the one who assisted her father in getting over Conor’s loss. Eric noted in his 2007 book,&nbsp;“Ruth has been an enormous help. I had no clue how much influence a kid could have on an adult’s life, how much it could make you feel legitimate, distinct, and powerful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ruth-Clapton-2.jpg><p>Ruth and her father fell out when she exposed personal information about her father on social media. She posted that her father had dressed up as Kermit the Frog for his 70th birthday. Aside from that, she uploaded photos of two Porsches in a garage at her father’s property. Eric disapproved of her behavior, so he punished her. In reaction, she said she no longer wanted to be a part of his life.</p><h2>Her Way of Life</h2><p>She lives a lavish lifestyle with her husband and children. She enjoys spending time with her family and creating memories. In an essay she wrote, she said she loves fashion and likes to buy a lot. She also enjoys taking family walks in the countryside. Here’s a photo from one of her vacations in Scarborough.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Her father is a rich guy with a $300 million net worth as of December 2023.</strong> Her father’s net wealth has grown significantly as a result of his work as a musician. He began his career at 17 when he joined a band named The Roosters. He later joined his second band, The Yardbirds. For Your Love, a successful track, was released in 1965. He afterward chose to establish his band. In 1996, he established the band Cream, which became one of the most influential rock bands of the time.</p><h2>Eric’s Honors and Accomplishments</h2><p>He has received 18 Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best Rock Song. He also received the NME Award for Best Guitarist in 1974.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiprqyYYrCtrc%2BtpqdlkaG5bq3BqKytZZWntqR5wqWYqayfo3qlrdSgn62domR5bXiLZWNl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
