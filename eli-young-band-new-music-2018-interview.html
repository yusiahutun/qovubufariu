This weekend's shows in their home state of Texas will mark an end to an extended break following the birth of a baby girl for guitarist James Young. They hope to play the songs soon, maybe.</p><p>"It's a big maybe," he admits. "We've been rehearsing one of the songs for about a month now ... this may be the weekend."</p><p>Any new music will be the first since the band's <a href=#>Fingerprints</a> album dropped last summer, but they've continued to write at a quick clip. Thompson says that's part of the fun of being in a band â€” you can write something and then bounce it off your friends immediately. Of course, they like to take it to their fans first.</p><p>"Our fans know kind of how we write and some of the topics we write about, and I think that that plays into the live show and how we put on a show," he says.</p><p>Thompson&nbsp;shares that the new music is targeted for a new album, but admits it's much too early to talk about when&nbsp;that may be released, because thus far they have just those two songs finished. Eli Young Band are known for hits like "Crazy Girl" and "Even If It Breaks Your Heart."</p><p><strong>Best Song of the 21st Century?
