According to a press release, the 36-year-old mother of two recently underwent a double mastectomy and will begin chemotherapy tomorrow (Sept. 6). Miller says she was extra cautious with her self-examinations, as her family has a history with breast cancer. However, she was not as diligent with regular mammograms.</p><p>And as Pickler reminded everyone, “Cancer does not discriminate."</p><p>“If this compels even one person to change their mentality toward waiting until the age of 40 for their mammogram, then it will be worth it,” Miller added.</p><p>In addition to the shocking haircut, Pickler revealed that Athena Water will be partnering with her and Miller as she battles cancer. Video of their journey will soon be available the company's <a href=#>website</a>, and they'll be making a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;$2 million donation to the American Cancer Society in Miller's honor.
