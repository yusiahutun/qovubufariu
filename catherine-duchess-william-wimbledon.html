Made up of pleated tiers, the dress gave a nod to the kind of skirts players traditionally wear on court at the All England Club. Those wishing to copy Kate's style can snap it up in the sale for £395 – reduced from its original price of £795. And Kate's not the only one keen on the designer – her sister Pippa wore a <span>gorgeous green Temperley dress</span> for her big sister's evening wedding reception. This week's fashion choice is just one of many times Kate has worn the shade lately. Her <span>spectacular wedding dress</span> aside – and this she loved so much she had <span>another version</span> made for the evening - there was the Reiss dress she wore for her <span>engagement shoot</span>. Then there was also the McQueen coat dress she wore at the <a class=hm-link href=#>Trooping the Colour</a> and the cream faux-tweed Jospeph jacket and chiffon Reiss dress at the <a class=hm-link href=#>Espom Derby</a>. It's a tried and tested formula for the newest member of the British royal family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/40a96a080ee0-wimbledon-2-z.jpg><p id=ephMlSZDCb-D data-wc=159>All eyes were on Kate, who - along with her husband&nbsp;- was cheered by fellow spectators as they made their way to their seats. It was the couple's first time in the royal box together, though the Duchess – a keen tennis fan – has been at the championships twice before. And it seems the presence of the royal couple brought Andy luck - there were more cheers as he powered past Richard Gasquet, beating the Frenchman in three sets in just under two hours. Kate looked to be thoroughly enjoying the chance to share her passion for the sport with William, and was seen chatting Gill Brooke, the wife of the Chairman of the All England Tennis Club. The 29-year-old also greeted Tim Henman's mum Jane with a kiss on the cheek before sharing a few words with her too.Also watching the match were <a class=hm-link href=#>Beyonce Knowles</a> and her husband Jay-Z, who are in the UK after the singer's <a class=hm-link href=#>Glastonbury set</a>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
