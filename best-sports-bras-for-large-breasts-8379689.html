An ill-fitting bra can easily derail your workout, leading to discomfort, pain, and even unnecessary extra effort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Whilst during yoga, your breasts move predominantly side to side and can experience displacement of up to five centimeters, activities such as jumping results in vertical breast displacement of up to 17.8 centimeters and running leads to movement in all directions (vertical, forwards, backwards, side to side),” Joanna Wakefield-Scurr—a professor in Biomechanics and Head of the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth—said in a recent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">press release</a> from Adidas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What does that translate to? An ill-fitting or under-supportive bra could actually negatively impact your workout as well as be uncomfortable. Back in 2020, that same research group (in conjunction with Brooks Running) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>found</a> that women lose up to four centimeters of stride length due to poorly controlled breast movement while running—which, over the length of a marathon, could translate to running an extra mile.

The design combines internal encapsulation with external compression, which makes it ideal for multiple workout types: “Because it’s not overly stretchy, it can be used for running, but it also locks down the top of the bust so breasts stay put when doing something like downward dog in yoga,” she says. Plus, if the bounce control panel at the front doesn’t immediately rein things in, there are four levels of adjustment at the shoulders to finetune the fit</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B to 46I | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Padding: </strong>no | <strong>Material: </strong>polyester, polyamide, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>hook and eye</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-all-in-motion-high-support-sculpt-zip-front-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>All In Motion High Support Sculpt Zip Front Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target All In Motion High Support Sculpt Zip Front Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/M8G9xMGqBZtlS_9Xr2ivgZNTmpM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/All-In-Motion-High-Support-Sculpt-Zip-Front-Bra-fa4dde952b1048f693ea74b73d47933f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The zipper front makes putting it on and taking it off easy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not as supportive as some more expensive options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t sleep on Target’s activewear, which is just as good as bold-name brands for a fraction of the price. Case in point: This All in Motion zip-front bra, which rings up at just $24. It can handle everything from yoga to running, and has all the essential features—like adjustable straps, molded cups, and moisture-wicking fabric—as well as a few just for fun, like that crisscross back.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>34B to 44DD | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Padding: </strong>Yes | <strong>Material: </strong>polyester, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-lululemon-enlite-zip-front-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>lululemon Enlite Zip Front Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Enlite Zip Front Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YaB2CNkZ1HDw62cKsz2zbnG3iLA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-Enlite-Zip-Front-Bra-f18409afd559400c85e80647c4faace3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The fabric is super smooth and lightweight&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The encapsulated cups means the zipper tends to stick out a bit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the case of Lululemon’s Enlite bra, the higher price tag is justified by the high-tech performance benefits. The brand invented an incredibly lightweight new fabric called Ultralu—it feels like butter—that supports up to 20 breast sizes without rubbing or chafing thanks to smooth, bonded seams. Add to that encapsulated cups that move with the breasts in all directions and thick straps to mitigate shoulder pain, and this bra can stand up to the most intense workouts. Fair warning that the encapsulated cups causes the zipper to lay flat but not flush with the body—you may see the outline under tight tops.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>A-DDD(E) cups | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>nylon, elastane, polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>hook and eye, zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-superfit-hero-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SuperFit Hero Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SuperFit Hero Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0qVyRs8MkhdaCL8JJ65asZixPVM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/superfit-hero-sports-bra-b08fed077d9b4f30808cd72106e25aa7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SuperFit Hero</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s available in sizes all the way up to 7X.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not adjustable at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does the SuperFit Hero Sports bra come in sizes up to 7X, it’s also available in 12 colors—there’s likely a combo for everyone. It’s made from the brand’s most popular SuperHold compression fabric, which easily stretches to accommodate you, but still holds everything in during medium-impact workouts thanks to a wide elastic underband. Plus, there are no distractions in the form of removable cups, padding, or inserts, and the flatlock seams guarantee no chafing. It is one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best plus size bras</a> on the market.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>L to 7X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 12 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Slip on</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-wacoal-lindsey-sport-contour-underwire-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wacoal Lindsey Sport Contour Underwire Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Bloomingdale's Wacoal Lindsey Sport Contour Underwire Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qQwMXcF1-ubysyDnRaKGz6HC1hg=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Wacoal-Lindsey-Sport-Contour-Underwire-Bra-3c08aeb156a74d00b04cc8a2fd674bda.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A little less coverage keeps from overwhelming small frames.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Mesh fabric may chafe under arms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a more traditional shape that doesn’t look as full coverage as some other sports bras (it is, but you’ll show a little more cleavage), Wacoal’s Lindsey bra is streamlined enough that it won’t overwhelm smaller frames. It still offers plenty of support, with underwire, microfiber slings on the seamless cups to minimize bounce, and adjustable straps that are cushioned in the front and convertible in the back.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32C to 40G | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Padding: </strong>yes | <strong>Material: </strong>polyester, spandex, nylon<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>hook and eye</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-impact-nike-alpha-womens-high-support-padded-adjustable-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Impact</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nike Alpha Women's High-Support Padded Adjustable Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nike Alpha Women's High-Support Padded Adjustable Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fpd0WX-WqzWfyq1uwo_V0DhVpEw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nike-Alpha-Womens-High-Support-Padded-Adjustable-Sports-Bra-96656e99d7b44247aa1be89d1b9133ed.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nike</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Hook and eye closure and adjustable straps help you find the perfect fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There’s a lack of inventory in certain colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nike hasn’t always been known for their size inclusivity, but after an overhaul of their sports bras, they’re now offering sizes XS (A to C) through 3X (F to G). “The Alpha Bra is designed for running and other high-intensity activities,” says Sandra Gail Frayna, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Hudson Premier Physical Therapy and Sports</a>, “and it features a compressive fit and adjustable extra-wide straps for maximum support.” Molded cups with engineered foam pads add to that support while minimizing bounce. It’s also available in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">zip-front style</a> for easy on and off. And no matter how many burpees your HIIT class calls for, ventilation panels let your skin breathe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS (A to C) to 3X (F to G) | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Padding: </strong>Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, nylon, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Hook and eye</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-running-shock-absorber-ultimate-run-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Running</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shock Absorber Ultimate Run Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shock Absorber Ultimate Run Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h5HvrlViPX-udfYhaJh2jRMEEfg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shock-Absorber-Ultimate-Run-Sports-Bra-411fa34dedb542f08e8cbb884ccfcabd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shock Absorber</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s designed specifically to support the motion of breasts while running</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The clasp at the upper back can be difficult for some people to fasten on their own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Running is a repetitive sport, and that relentless up-and-down motion can be brutal for larger breasts. This combination bra—which has a dedicated following among larger-busted runners, says Tempesta—was designed specifically to support the figure eight motion breasts make during a run. And nearly every feature prioritizes comfort: The seamless microfiber lining of the cups and covered elastic under the arms combat chafing; the moisture-wicking underband keeps sweat from pooling; and the wide, cushioned shoulder straps have multiple insertion slots for a customized fit. Pro tip: The less you bounce, the further and faster you can go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30A-38G<strong> </strong>&nbsp;| <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, polyester, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Hook and eye, slide and snap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-front-closure-enell-full-coverage-high-impact-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Front Closure</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ENELL High Impact Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon ENELL Full Coverage High Impact Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q_QxdBxKcDVkGuBfkVp0gSFcSP0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ENELL-Full-Coverage-High-Impact-Sports-Bra-cb4083f597c14fa188c68655b9ab0ca6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The front closure makes it easy to get on and off.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Fabric may feel heavy or less breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Oprah once declared this her favorite sports bra,” says Tempesta, and who would argue with Oprah? If you’re looking for the ultimate lockdown support, Enell’s design combines encapsulated cups (which are double-layered to support a natural shape) with a compressive fit to hold the breast tissue down. “I love the front closure feature because it makes it easy for those who have trouble reaching around their backs to put the bra on or take it off,” says Tempesta.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00 to 4 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Hook and eye</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-zip-closure-shefit-ultimate-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Zip Closure</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheFit Ultimate Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheFit Ultimate Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TzKF55K4fx4xRkoqz0qRQisFU_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shefit-ultimate-sports-bra-a6ab811342374d62bee812f1ae59d090.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SheFit</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The zip front and adjustable back allow for lots of adjustability.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It may be a little low-cut for some wearers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shedding a sweaty sports bra shouldn’t be harder than your workout—a fact that begs the question: why aren’t there more zip-front sports bras? “The SheFIT Ultimate Sports Bra fits better than most zip-front sports bras because it has both a back adjuster and a front zip,” says Tempesta, which allows for adjustability in most areas. It can be a little low-cut on some wearers, she warns, but if you’ve had trouble finding a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sports bra</a> that fits you snugly, this one’s for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS to 6Luxe | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Padding: </strong>Yes | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, nylon, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-underwire-elomi-energise-full-figure-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Underwire</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elomi Energise Full Figure Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Elomi Women's Plus-Size Energise Underwire Sport Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3Cdo1q9UdlX1G5d64UBGwKyN8MY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/elomi-womens-plus-size-energise-underwire-sport-bra-eb42375f6bcd4495a76db67b0465f454.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It offers a huge range of cup and band sizes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Straps are narrow and may provide less support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Underwire offers extra support for larger breasts—but embedding them in sports bras can require heavy layers of fabric or foam, says Tempesta. This one from Elomi, though, tucks those wires within a lightweight, microfiber fabric that wicks moisture away from the skin. And even though the design isn’t compressive, everything should feel snug and secure in the three-piece cups that pair with a side support panel to shape, separate, and lift the breasts. A subtle J-hook on the straps transforms the bra from a straight strap to an x-back, making it easier to pair with more cute workout tops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>D to K<strong> </strong>&nbsp;| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Closure: </strong>Hook and eye, J-hook<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-racerback-under-armour-ua-infinity-mid-covered-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Racerback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Under Armour UA Infinity Mid Covered Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Under Armour UA Infinity Mid Covered Sports Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PrDj_AKnM5G2t0L_CPxp6sPDPio=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/under-armour-ua-infinity-mid-covered-sports-bra-864978a014344891aaa5d237dfbcbffb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Under Armour</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The simple, streamlined look.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may not be supportive enough for larger band sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“As a petite and curvy gym rat myself, this bra gives ultimate support and coverage without feeling bulky or tight,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Morgan Bienvenue</a>, a stylist and brand consultant.

Combination bras use both technologies.” While those with smaller busts can generally get adequate support from compression-only styles, encapsulation and combination bras are generally best for larger busts. Our favorite compression-only bra is <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Champion Spot Comfort Full Support Bra</a>.

A wider strap, like on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nike Alpha</a>, can prevent the bra from digging into your shoulders and leave marks. While a racerback style has straps (see: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Under Armour UA Infinity Mid Covered Sports Bra</a>) that cross in the back, giving a bit of lift that can take some pressure off. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Champion Spot Comfort Full Support Bra</a> has gel-cushioned straps for a more comfortable experience.

Instead, “look for sports bras that fit like they were custom made for you,” says Tempesta. That means the bra can be adjusted at multiple points to finetune the fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The type of workout you’re doing will also play a role in what type of bra you should wear. “The more the bra stretches the more the breasts will move, but the more the bra stretches the more comfortable it is,” says Tempesta. “If you are doing an activity where your breasts aren’t moving much, opt for stretch and comfort. If you are doing a high-impact activity, opt for less stretch.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should a sports bra for large breasts have padding?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Padding is more of an aesthetic addition to sports bras, in that it prevents your nipples from being noticeable. In some cases, padding can add extra support, but most bras for larger breasts are designed to help support natural motion via molded cups, thicker straps, side supports, and other features. It’s really an issue of personal preference.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should all sports bras for large breasts be full coverage?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More support comes from more coverage, so you should look for sports bras with higher necklines or wider front panels for high-impact workouts like running. You can likely get away with less coverage during lower-impact activities, like yoga or pilates. In many cases, coverage will be a matter of personal preference—if you have a larger cup size, a sports bra with more coverage may prevent you from spilling out of it, but maybe you like to show a little cleavage. Remember: Sports bras should fit snugly, but they shouldn’t be restrictive. A sports bra that fits you properly should support you whether it’s full coverage or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ashley Mateo</a> is an award-winning journalist and editor who currently works as a freelance editorial consultant.
