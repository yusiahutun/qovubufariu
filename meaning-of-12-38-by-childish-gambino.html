The song's overall theme seems to center around the complexities of love and personal growth, exploring how these elements can intertwine and shape one's experiences.One standout lyric in the song is when Gambino sings, "Someone made a mess in my account, someone sound like me, yes." This lyric introduces the idea of external influences affecting one's life and potentially causing chaos. It can represent the pressures of fame or the vulnerability of allowing others to have control over personal matters. This theme can be further explored by examining the line, "Bode, Bentley addict, I go manic." Here, Gambino reckons with his own obsessions and addictive tendencies, suggesting that intense desires can lead to moments of instability or recklessness.Another significant lyric is when Gambino recalls an encounter with a love interest who offers him psilocybin, a psychedelic substance. He initially expresses confusion, not knowing what psilocybin is and expressing concern about it being "no molly." This lyric can symbolize the apprehension and uncertainty that often accompanies new experiences, especially in the realm of love and self-discovery. As Gambino takes a bite of dark chocolate sea salt, the lyric "We gon' have a special night" highlights the transformative nature of love and how it can turn a simple moment into a cherished memory. This theme ties into the broader concept of embracing the unknown and finding joy in unexpected situations.The line "Most these niggas wanna run around with these SZAs, I prefer to just stroll the park with this Chaka" explores the idea of valuing genuine connections and meaningful experiences over fleeting encounters. It suggests that Gambino seeks depth and substance in relationships rather than superficiality or a desire for status. This theme can be further developed by considering the lyric, "Put a finger to my two lips, it's okay," which can symbolize the freedom to speak one's truth and express oneself without fear of judgment. It ties into the overarching theme of self-acceptance and embracing personal desires.The introduction of 21 Savage's verse introduces a different perspective to the song, touching on topics such as success, police harassment, and materialism. His lyrics highlight the challenges faced by successful individuals who encounter prejudice and jealousy due to their achievements. These lyrics expand the song's themes to include societal expectations and the pressure to conform. The line, "I'm on a private jet eatin' Popeyes chicken, I be flexin' like I'm eatin' Popeye's spinach," juxtaposes luxurious experiences with humble origins, suggesting that material possessions do not define personal growth or happiness. This theme reinforces the idea that true fulfillment comes from within, rather than external validations.Overall, "12.38" is a multifaceted song that explores various themes related to love, personal growth, and societal pressures. Through its imaginative and unexpected lyrics, the song invites listeners to reflect on their own experiences and encourages self-acceptance, embracing the unknown, and finding joy in the journey of discovering oneself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyktMilm6KrmGK0ornBoqWoZ52arq%2B1zaBkqJ5dZn9uf5dmmbJlk522rbDIrJ9mn5Gir6q6zg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
