She opted for a nude lipstick and soft tones on her eyes.</p><p>Since she shared the sizzling snaps more than 1,600 people have liked them, and people were quick to comment too. People told her she was on "fire" as she heated things up in the bathtub.</p><p>One person said: "Happy birthday to the sexiest lady I have ever seen." Another added: "The most beautiful chapter. Happy Birthday."</p><p>A third replied: "Would love to join u in there." Meanwhile, a fourth commented: "The most beautiful and the most perfect woman does exist."</p><p>Her latest snaps may just be some of her raciest yet, as it's not often she strips to the bare minimum. She really teased fans as she frolicked in the bathtub, and they've been left pretty stunned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31296482.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Im-sick-of-being-skinny-shamed-people-loved-my-confidence-and-arrogance-before-I-lost-100lbs-but.jpg><p>Previously Apollonia <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>told Daily Star she had lots of plans to travel this year</a> – and her snaps imply she's really made the most of it too. She's been snapped everywhere from the US to Mykonos this year where she's been seen donning some particularly saucy looks.</p><p>Previously, the model said: "I have done so much this year, and added many things to my career. Pictures of me are always so varied and so different.</p><p>"However, I can say I have never done anything that’s too showy. Always just bikini, lingerie and fashion – my fans know my style."</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaJ6RqLWqu81mmZ6ZpanGcLzAoJxma12XrqOxjKaYpJ2jYsCxuMCsn2ZrYWiAdXyYag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
