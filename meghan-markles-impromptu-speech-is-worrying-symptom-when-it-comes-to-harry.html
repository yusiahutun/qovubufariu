I had to spend a little more time getting our little ones settled at home and get them to drop off. Three milkshakes and a school drop off and I just landed a couple of hours ago.”</p><p>The internet has branded the Duchess as “self-absorbed” for the consistent use of “I” and talking about her own family, instead of focusing on the veterans.</p><p>“She speaks and still says ‘I’ and ‘me’ a dozen times,” criticized a <a href=#>Prince William</a> and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> fan. “Sorry ‘I’ was late. ‘I’ was buying milkshakes. ‘I can’t wait to bring MY children.’ ALWAYS makes it all about herself somehow.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Daniela Elser, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">royal expert</a> at News.com.au, noted that the short address showed “worrying symptoms of an infliction suffered by her brother-in-law Prince William, I-itis,” – a reference to how they tend to talk in the first person when sharing thoughts in speeches.</p><p>Elser added that “the cuff-ness was definitely showing” as Meghan used the word “I” 11 times in her statements.</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, focused on the importance of the competitors to “connect with each other”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1682544658-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-keeps-it-casual-at-invictus-2023-in-high-street-brand>Meghan Markle keeps it casual at Invictus 2023 in high-street brand</h2><p>Markle usually steps out in her luxury staples, including her Chanel slingbacks, Hermes scarf, and Goyard tote, but she switched out the pricy items for a more accessible look at this year’s games.</p><p>The Duchess rocked a black Banana Republic shirt dress that now retails for less than $60.
