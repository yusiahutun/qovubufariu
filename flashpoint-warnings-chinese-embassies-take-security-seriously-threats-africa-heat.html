But that is no longer the case.</p>“China is increasingly beginning to realise that a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">security strategy</span></a> that is predicated on depending on local partners to intervene in security situations that affect Chinese interests is not enough,” Nantulya said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He explained that is because local partners might not have the capacity or the political will to assist, or their attention might be diverted elsewhere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a sense within the Chinese security establishment that China needs to begin addressing these security concerns increasingly on its own using its own resources and using its own response mechanism,” Nantulya said.</p>“China is pursuing a security mix in Africa and in other parts of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Global South</span></a>. I think what we see in Kenya is a manifestation of the kind of security investments that China has made in recent years and that includes early warning.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Andrew Franklin, a Kenya-based security analyst and former US marine, said there has been a significant increase in the number of Chinese people living and working in Nairobi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/03/0937efc7-63f9-4bcf-a441-bc565c1a334e_ac707f82.jpg>In 2019, there were an estimated 180,000 Chinese workers in Kenya.

Franklin said they are often found at entertainment venues popular with expats and wealthy Kenyans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The embassy alert shows cognisance of enhanced security threats from al-Shabab as well as the growth in ordinary crime caused by the declining economy and the apparent inability of police to respond to rising insecurity,” Franklin said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Chinese embassy is acting responsibly and with well-considered concern to warn its citizens to remain alert and to exercise reasonable caution, especially when mixing with Americans and other Westerners.”</p>Stig Jarle Hansen, a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and an expert on Islamism in the Horn of Africa, said the number of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">al-Shabab attacks</span></a> in Kenya over the last year has increased, but they have been in areas near the Somalian border – in Wajir, Garissa and Lamu – due to historical reasons.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Al-Shabab have carried out attacks in Kenya ever since it sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to fight the al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadists.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/18/Clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:48</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese President Xi Jinping unveils 8-point vision for nation’s Belt and Road Initiative at forum</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping unveils 8-point vision for nation’s Belt and Road Initiative at forum</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hansen said al-Shabab have also pledged to fight against the Israeli effort in Gaza.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This might motivate them to plan attacks,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a key US ally in East Africa, Kenya has borne the brunt of security threats, and has suffered deadly terror attacks.
