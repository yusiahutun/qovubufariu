It retails for approximately $4,800.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kate-middleton-watch-0.jpg><p>Kate sporting her Cartier wristwatch.

The gem is a sweet nod to the 12-carat sapphire and diamond engagement ring — that once belonged to the late Princess Diana! —&nbsp;Prince William presented to Kate back in 2010 when the royal couple became engaged. According to <a href=#>Popsugar</a>, William gifted Kate the pretty watch just before the duo jetted off to Australia and New Zealand in July 2014 on their first royal tour with son George.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Is Kate Middleton Pregnant?

While they were <a href=#>dating at St Andrews University</a> in Scotland back in the mid-2000s, the prince gave his then-girlfriend, Kate, a rose-gold Victorian ring studded with pearls and garnets. The ring was extra special because it included William’s June birthstone, pearl, and Kate’s January birthstone, garnet.</p><p>When the couple tied the knot in April 2011, Kate was gifted a yellow gold wedding band to wear with her famous engagement ring. The bauble is a tradition for royal brides as it’s made out of from a lump of Welsh gold owned by the monarchy. The mom-of-two additionally dons a diamond eternity band —&nbsp;designed by Annoushka —&nbsp;on her ring finger. It was a “push present” from William when she <a href=#>gave birth to George in July 2013</a>.</p><h2>More From Closer Weekly<br></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Middleton’s Diet Is So Simple You Can Probably Do It Yourself!</a></p><p><a href=#>Kate Middleton Wows in Unusual Pearl Necklace During Poland Tour — Get the Details on Her Style Overhaul!</a></p><p>[<a href=#>Kate Middleton’s Gorgeous New Hair Has Officially Been Dubbed the “Kob”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kmK2dXaK2pbDLnquopl2srrWvx2ZobG9iZYZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
