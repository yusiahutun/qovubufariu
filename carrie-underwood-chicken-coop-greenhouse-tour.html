Along the way, Underwood offered a tour of her property, including the chicken coop where her hens (and rooster!) live, plus the outdoor garden of raised beds that wraps around her greenhouse.</p><p>As a bonus, fans who watch along can get a glimpse of the incredible treehouse that the singer and her husband, former hockey pro Mike Fisher, had built for their two kids. While their mom is gardening, seven-year-old Isaiah and four-year-old Jacob can play in the incredibly detailed and realistic structure, which also features an enormous slide.</p><p>Press play above to watch the comprehensive full video, which clocks in at just under 27 minutes and includes lots of details on what Underwood's got growing in her garden and newly-furnished greenhouse -- including strawberries, trees for her orchard, root crops, seedlings and much more.</p><p>Underwood has always kept a robust garden growing on her ultra-private Nashville property, which she maintains despite the rigorous travel schedule that her current Denim & Rhinestones Tour imposes. The singer's garden has long been "my happy place," and she frequently checks in with fans from her gardening beds, in posts like this <a href=#>garden tour </a>from summer 2022.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Breathtaking Nashville Mansion</h2><p>Carrie Underwood and her husband, Mike Fisher, owned a 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom, 2-half-bathroom home in an affluent Nashville suburb called Brentwood. The 7,000-square-foot mansion features a wet bar, fitness center and tennis court, as well as a four-car garage, walk-out basement with heated marble floors and extra appliances, including a sub-zero fridge and wine fridge. That house is where Underwood suffered a devastating fall in 2017.</p><p>The couple sold the luxurious home for $1,410,000 in March of 2019, after they moved into the massive dream home that they had spent several years building from scratch.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Beautiful Post-'American Idol' Home</h2><p>Carrie Underwood invested her money wisely after winning American Idol in 2005. One of her first big purchases was a 3,099-square-foot home in the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. Underwood paid $384,000 for a luxurious 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stone and stucco home in a private gated community.</p><p>The house features a library, a vaulted ceiling and lovely amenities throughout, but while it's very nice, it's certainly not the kind of home you'd picture for a budding country superstar. Underwood wound up being a huge success right out of the gate with her debut album, Some Hearts, and she sold the home in Franklin for $372,500 in 2007, when she purchased the Brentwood mansion that she would later share with her husband, Mike Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnCoaCco5WjeqS7zqlkoKqVmrupu9SsnGasn6q%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
