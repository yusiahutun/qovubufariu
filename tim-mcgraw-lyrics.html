For over 20 years, <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>has connected with country fans through powerful lyrics from hit singles like 'Don't Take the Girl,' and later, 'Live Like You Were Dying.' While the singer isn't known as a prolific songwriter, he's an expert at finding songs that fit his life like a pair of well-worn cowboy boots. McGraw always seems comfortable telling stories through his lyrics. It always feels like it's his story.</p><p>We've chosen five of the best lines from his biggest hits -- the ones that have influenced the most country music fans or that are just so vivid and imaginative that one has to just sit back and appreciate his artistry. If there is another song with better Tim McGraw lyrics, tell everyone about it in the comment section below.</p><ul><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>5</span><h2>'I Need You'</h2>%22I wanna get lost in some corner booth / Cantina Mexico / I wanna dance to the static of an AM radio / I wanna wrap the moon around us / And lay beside you skin on skin / Make love 'til the sun comes up, 'til the sun goes down again / ‘Cause I need you.%22<p>This Grammy-nominated duet with <a href=#>Faith Hill</a> may have ended up being their most well-known collaboration, if another song on this list of Tim McGraw lyrics hadn't competed with it for chart space. David Lee and Tony Lane wrote this 2007 Top 10 hit. It's a dark and smoky love song which describes the physical addiction of love. The famous couple's performance is equally as stirring.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>4</span><h2>'Something Like That'</h2>%22I had a barbeque stain on my white T-shirt / She was killing me in that mini-skirt / Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks / She had a suntan line and red lipstick / I worked so hard for that first kiss / And a heart don't forget something like that.%22<p>While this song isn't a tearjerker like others on this lyrics list, it's a wonderful story that so many fans of the country singer have been able to connect with since its 1999 release. Rick Ferrell and Keith Follesé wrote the lyrics to 'Something Like That.' It was the second single from McGraw's 'A Place in the Sun' album.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>3</span><h2>'If You're Reading This'</h2>%22So lay me down / In that open field out on the edge of town / And know my soul / Is where my mama always prayed that it would go / If you're reading this / I'm already home.%22<p>In 2007, McGraw penned this song with the Warren Brothers and insisted on playing it at the ACM Awards instead of his then-charting single 'I Need You.' Quickly, radio stations began playing the live version of this song, much to the dismay of his record label. Eventually it was released as a single and became a Top 5 hit. 'If You're Reading This' is the rare war song that focuses on the fallen in a way that country fans universally agree is respectable. The emotional story is a no-brainer for this list of the Best Tim McGraw Lyrics.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>2</span><h2>'Don't Take the Girl'</h2>%22Take the very breath you gave me / Take the heart from my chest / I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me / Make this my last request / Take me out of this world / God, please don't take the girl.%22<p>This Craig Martin and Larry W. Johnson-written hit is the oldest song on this Tim McGraw Lyrics list. The 1994 smash was McGraw's first chart-topper, and an early example of his sharp storytelling skills. Anyone who is a parent has found him or herself wiping away tears after listening to this song.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>1</span><h2>'Live Like You Were Dying'</h2>%22And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter / And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying / And he said, 'Some day I hope you get the chance / To live like you were dying.'%22<p>Tim Nichols helped Craig Wiseman write what we feel are the best Tim McGraw lyrics ever written. There is no doubt that McGraw was able to apply parts of the song to personal experience, as his father, Tug McGraw, was battling cancer at the time. It's a very personal song that fans were, and are, still able to apply to their own lives. There isn't another line of lyrics more inspiring than those in 'Live Like You Were Dying.'</p></li></ul><h2>What Are Your Favorite Tim McGraw Lyrics?</h2><p>Are there some Tim McGraw lyrics that have moved you more than one of these five lines?
