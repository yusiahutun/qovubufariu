The <a href=# id=auto-tag_xbox data-tag=xbox>Xbox</a> Series X and the <a href=# id=auto-tag_xbox-series data-tag=xbox-series>Xbox Series</a> S—known collectively as the Xbox Series X/S—launched in November 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding 2013’s Xbox One. Along with the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S are a part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.</p><p>Compared to past Xbox consoles, the Xbox Series X features higher-end hardware and higher display resolutions—up to 8K—as well as higher frame rates and real-time ray tracing for faster and more efficient gaming. The console also has a high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times. The Xbox Series S, which uses a similar central processing unit but a less powerful graphics processing unit, is more affordable than the Xbox Series X but includes less memory and internal storage and lacks the optical drive that makes the Xbox Series X so popular. Both consoles, however, are designed to support almost all Xbox One games, controllers and accessories—as well as many games from older Xbox consoles. Both consoles are also compatible with gaming subscription services such as Xbox Game Pass, as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming, a cloud game-streaming platform.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“It is a really amazing console. Just setting it up and downloading a few games for my son, I could really notice the download speed and performance upgrades,” reads one review on Amazon. Another reviewer wrote, “Incredible machine.

Here’s what users are saying about the X Box Series X.</p><p>One reviewer complimented the Xbox Series X’s speed compared to past Xbox <a href=#>consoles</a>. “The Xbox Series X addresses the Xbox One X’s weakest point: speed. It has a powerful CPU in addition to its monstrous GPU and has built-in SSD. You’ll be impressed with the speed from the get-go,” the review read.</p><p>“The initial setup was super fast and it even allows you to copy settings from the cloud that it backed up from your previous console. You’ll be up and running in no time, and if you are a Gamepass subscriber, you’ll have great games to play.” The review continued, “The backwards compatibility truly shines and it is a joy going back to some of your favorite titles that perform better now with the power of the Series X…I quite like how the new controller feels and it seems they made some minor yet meaningful tweaks to it overall. The bumpers seem more responsive to me and the share button is a useful addition.”</p><p><strong>Save $20 off your first order with HSN using the promo code HSN2022.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/xbox-series-s-bundle.jpeg><p>While not quite as powerful as its beefy Series X counterpart, the Series S is a more budget, beginner-friendly console for those still wanting to experience what this latest X Box console has to offer and save $50 in the process.

Over the course of the night, you play as each of the nine characters and, depending on your choices, some of them may not make it through til sunrise. This game flew under the radar a bit when it first came out so it’s at a 72% discount, there’s never been a better time to try it. It’s Just $17 down from $59.99.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg><p>The first time Square Enix forayed into the Marvel Universe with Marvel’s Avengers, it… didn’t go so well. The game wasn’t well received by critics or players. It’s unfortunate because those negative reviews tainted what would be a really fantastic release in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>: no microtransactions, no multiplayer, and a great story. According to a review by IGN: “Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough.” You can get it for $14.99 down from $59.99, which is a saving of 75%. Huge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/madden-23.jpg><p>For the football fan, you can’t miss&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Madden NFL 2023</a> with, for the first time, its namesake coach John Madden on the cover. The game introduces the all-new FieldSENSE Gameplay System, which provides the foundation for consistent, ultra-realistic gameplay, and equips players with more control at all positions in every mode. Score this iconic title for $29.99, which is $40 (57%) off the original price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shadow-of-the-tombraider.jpeg><p>Likely the last in the&nbsp;Tombraider&nbsp;reboot series (though surely not the final ever in the franchise) comes&nbsp;Shadow of the Tombraider&nbsp;from Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix. IGN said the environments “deliver a wonderfully eerie atmosphere too. An omnipresent cult, an unnerving, string-based score, and an aggressive subterranean enemy type, The Yaaxil, mean Shadow of the Tomb Raider frequently feels like a horror game, which makes for wonderfully tense exploration as you wade through mountains of bodies or hear an animalistic growl in the distance. Once again, there’s that clever homage being paid to the 1996 original; in this instance to its weird, psychedelic heart.” Get your hands on it for just $17.99, down from $24.99.</p><p><strong>Save $20 off your first order with HSN using the promo code HSN2022.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Watch-This-Space.png alt='"Watch This Space" - Amazon Prime Video' width=670 height=155 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
