During the tour, he stopped by Jimmy Fallon’s studio, and you know this one’s going to be a laugh. From start to finish, <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> was in fits of giggles, especially over his High School Reunion.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-467189152.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bradley-cooper-can-t-stop-laughing-at-high-school-reunion>Bradley Cooper ‘can’t stop laughing’ at High School reunion</h2><p>Such a big fan of the reunions, The Hangover star has been to three of them already! 20th, 25th, and 30th, which took place two weeks ago. “It was great,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>We’d love to hear the story of how great it was, however, Brad and the <a href=#>TV</a> host were in such fits of laughter, they could barely get their words out.</p><p>Brad, who is rumored to be <a href=#>dating Gigi Hadid</a>, explained he “got there early,” to which Fallon replied: “When did you get there? The 29th anniversary?” and the giggles just didn’t stop from there.</p><p>At one point, the <a href=#>movie</a> star even got up to walk off and leave, as he gasped: “I can’t do it,” struggling to breathe from laughter.</p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn’t really a story, except for the fact Cooper turned up early and put the sign out front. He even wore a name tag, although we’re sure he didn’t need one.</p><p>“In high school, I used to go by Brad, and now I go by Bradley. I felt like it was some weird imposter putting my – but that is my real name, Bradley.”</p><p>Jimmy then proceeded to show a picture of the humble king with his name tag on with his friend, Bucky Holmes. Of course, the host had to ask if anyone “freaks out” that he’s ‘now’ Bradley Cooper, which they surprisingly don’t.</p><p>“No. no, it was awesome. It was like, regular,” he explained. “Time has passed, and yeah, it was just cool.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-makes-a-controversial-statement>The star makes a controversial statement</h2><p>The fact Bradley got up off his chair in a fit of laughter is kind of fitting, going by his latest controversial statement.</p><p>The A Star is Born actor recently revealed he <a href=#>doesn’t allow chairs</a> on the sets of films he’s directing.</p><p>“There’s no chairs. I’ve always hated chairs on sets; your energy dips the minute you sit down in a chair,” the director revealed in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Variety.</p><p>Although X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, was taken back at the revelation, he’s not the only one.
