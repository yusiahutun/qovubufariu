In another clip, Kylie hugs Timothee from behind.</p><p>So, when did their relationship start? It all started in April, when Deux Moi received an anonymous tip that the two were dating. &nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;published paparazzi photos of Timothee and Kylie. They were supposedly on a low-key date in Santa Monica. “Here’s the deal, Timothee was at an art show last Friday in Santa Monica … and appeared to be waiting out front for a ride, which is when Kylie’s Lincoln Navigator pulled up with her security guards in the front seat,” the tabloid reported. “We’re told the actor quickly jumped in the back of her ride, while one of Kylie’s guards drove Timothee’s Escalade behind them. The cars ended up next door at L.A. staple Tito’s Tacos, with Kylie’s team getting food and bringing it to the back seat—where Timothee and Kylie were sitting.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>&nbsp;More sites also came forward with the relationship news. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;published quotes from an anonymous source that said the couple is hanging out but it’s only casual at this stage. “Kylie has only hung out with Timothée a couple of times, so things aren’t that serious. However, she’s enjoying getting to know him better and is open to seeing where things go,” a source told the magazine. “Things are very new so it’s hard to tell, but so far she likes what she sees.”</p><p>The source added: “Timothée is a total gentleman and treats [Kylie] with respect. He’s very charming and he makes her laugh, and he’s easy to talk to. He’s not like any of the other guys she’s dated before and although he may not seem like her type, they have really good chemistry.”</p><p>Another source told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>, the twosome are talking to each other every day. “Kylie and Timothée text, FaceTime or communicate in some way almost every day. They have a really fun and flirty exchange between them, and he makes Kylie smile.”</p><p>The source continued, saying that they’re looking to the future. “Kylie is definitely open to seeing Timothée again, but she’s letting him take the lead. She enjoys being courted and feels like the more effort he puts in, the more she likes him, the insider shared. “At the same time, she appreciates that he doesn’t feel the need to go super over the top with grand gestures just to impress her. Despite what some people may think, Kylie really is down-to-earth and laidback. Having some tacos and just hanging out is a perfect date idea for her.” Fast forward to June and the two’s families have met each other.</p><p>As for the PDA, it isn’t the first time that Kylie and Timothée’s kiss made headlines. In an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram photo dump</a>&nbsp;published by Kylie on June 14, 2023, there’s a photo in which Kylie is holding her baby boy on her hip, with one hand on top of her pinned-up hair. A few eagle-eyed fans noticed a small “hickey” on the side of her neck. “Am I the only one who peeps the hickey,” asked one fan Jenner’s Instagram comments section, to which another user replied, “what r [sic] they 12?&nbsp;.”</p><p>“Uhm ms kylie, we see that hickey,” added another. “Is that a hickey on pic #5,” commented a third user. “hickies on her neck,” wrote a fourth.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
