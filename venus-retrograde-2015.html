And judging by the number of A-list&nbsp;couples calling it quits,&nbsp;it seems to be more break-ups than make-ups.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As background,&nbsp;Venus went retrograde on July 25&nbsp;while still in the critical and&nbsp;somewhat picky&nbsp;sign of Virgo, and as she continued her journey back to the generous but also egotistical sign of Leo, self-importance and pride bubbled up. In this position, arguments can rise to a point of no-return.&nbsp;On the other hand, if couples deal with their issues, then their relationships can grow to a point of strength where nothing can touch them. But this takes work, not just from one person but from both sides.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Venus is the lover of romance, sensuality and magic, but she does have another side that is&nbsp;possessive, stubborn and bitchy. And then add to the mix planetary interactions between Saturn, who has a very long memory, the acid tongue of Mars, idealism of Jupiter and unpredictable Uranus, emotions can get frayed. Venus Retrograde can bring up a lot of past issues and&nbsp;old baggage&nbsp;that has not been dealt with. And the all-powerful Sun steps in to provide energy to remove emotional blocks, but sometimes, things have just gone too far to be resolved. People from the past can&nbsp;reappear during this time, and as Venus also rules money, fiscal issues can&nbsp;come into play.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, what's the real story behind each of the news-making&nbsp;breakups? Here's inside the&nbsp;Zodiac story:&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Jennifer Garner</strong>, an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;Aries,&nbsp;and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Ben Affleck</strong>, an ambitious&nbsp;Leo,&nbsp;seemed like a solid couple, but these two fire signs are strong-headed, and when there is not enough family together time, they find it&nbsp;easy to walk different paths. And sooner or later, it's like they are living different lives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Gwen Stefani</strong>, a peace-loving Libra ruled by Venus, and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Gavin Rossdale</strong>, a sexy Scorpio, said&nbsp;goodbye after 13 years. Gwen needs a deep friendship and family commitment, and Gavin needs structure but also freedom. If these two were not on the same&nbsp;page with each other as to their personal needs, then Venus&nbsp;Retrograde can have them finally saying&nbsp;'enough is enough'. A hurt Libra can become contrary, and if a Scorpio feels they are not understood, they can look elsewhere for this validation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Charlize Theron</strong> and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Sean Penn</strong>, both Leos, can have trouble sharing&nbsp;the spotlight. And with Venus in Leo, this puts pressure on the relationship. If old unfavorable patterns start to arise, or similarities of past relationships come to the forefront, this can be enough to make any couple rethink their commitment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>, a fiery Aries, and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Scott Disick</strong>, a&nbsp;life-of-the-party Gemini, can have totally different values. When Gemini doesn't take Aries seriously enough, that's the first indication of trouble. During this Venus Retrograde&nbsp;for Kourtney, family is important, and&nbsp;probably for the first time in Scott's life he has nothing to say&nbsp;that will sooth Kourtney's soul, resulting in irrevocable communication issues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> is an ambitious Leo and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Chris Martin</strong>&nbsp;a dreamy Pisces. When these two get together, just the two of them in their private world, nothing is sweeter,&nbsp;but aligning their&nbsp;life, values and schedules is&nbsp;not so easy. It's when they get out into the real world that the trouble starts. Jennifer as a Leo has high expectations and Chris as a Pisces tunes into his intuition and follows it, regardless of joint decisions. He can get totally lost in his work and own world. And Venus Retrograde can make their differences seem blaringly obvious.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Blake Shelton</strong> is a creative and party-loving Gemini&nbsp;and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Miranda Lambert</strong>&nbsp;a sexy, sultry Scorpio. Gemini is friendly to everyone, and this can drive a possessive Scorpio crazy. Gemini has a great deal of compromise in them, and doesn't&nbsp;take life too seriously, whereas Scorpio is far more intense&nbsp;and can push the boundaries. Scorpio needs boundaries set loud and clear&nbsp;for them and their partner, and if their partner doesn't take this seriously, then one day&nbsp;someone is just going to walk away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Megan Fox</strong>, a sensual Taurus, and <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Brian Austin Green</strong>, a sensitive Cancer, can be a good match, understanding each other's needs. They both love&nbsp;money, luxury, home, food and family. A Cancer man can be very ambitious, and building wealth is number one for him, and the same goes for Taurus. But there are other things more important to both these signs. Once they own their home, it no longer becomes a possession, it is now an important place to gather, be together and build family memories. Success comes with a price and for these two, trying to have it all&nbsp;can be too challenging with their commitments.&nbsp;Venus Retrograde can put that extra stress on a relationship, highlighting the same old&nbsp;situation with the&nbsp;feeling that nothing will change.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Venus finally comes out of her retrograde transit on September 6, it is possible that some of these couples will reignite, but not without considerable effort. However, Venus does not return to the degree it first started its retrograde journey until October 9, so it will take a whole lot of&nbsp;love and dedication to make it stick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfnbyzu9Kcpqmdo2Sucn2YbmporpWjwrR50Z6rq6eXp66lsYxrZ2ptXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
