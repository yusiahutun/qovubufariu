The Final Score star <a href=#>flashed a smile as he posed by his wife’s side</a> in their marching ensembles in honor of this year’s theme: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”</p><p>The New York outing marks the first time Brosnan and Smith<a href=#> were in attendance at fashion’s biggest night</a>. The couple previously offered <a href=#>glimpses into their low-key romance with several red carpet appearances</a> throughout their decades-long marriage.</p><p>Before exchanging vows with Smith, the Golden Globe nominee was married to Cassandra Harris from 1980 <a href=#>until her death in 1991</a>. Over the course of his first marriage, the actor and Harris welcomed son Sean, 39. The Mamma Mia! star <a href=#>also adopted Harris’ daughter Charlotte and son Chris</a>, 50, from a previous marriage after their father passed. (Charlotte <a href=#>passed away in 2013 at age 41</a> following a battle with ovarian cancer.)</p><p>Brosnan <a href=#>found love again after meeting Smith</a> during a trip to Mexico in 1994. After nearly seven years of dating, the pair exchanged vows in 2001. They also expanded their family with sons Dylan, 26, and Paris, 22.</p><p>The Tomorrow Never Dies star later opened up about how <a href=#>he was able to move on following Harris’ passing</a>. “I had a great marriage which sadly had its own ending, and I was lucky enough to find love again. We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day,” he told Closer in January 2018. “When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”</p><p>Brosnan recalled <a href=#>his search for The One</a> before he crossed paths with Smith. “You have to trust and follow your heart. And try to meet the best people in life,” he added at the time. “I’ve been a married man most of my life — that’s the way I like it. I’m one of those guys who believes you need a strong woman in your life.”</p><p>Ahead of the duo’s date night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ireland native revealed <a href=#>his subtle attempt to honor Smith while filming projects</a> such as Black Adam.</p><p>“This is our wedding ring and this is a watch that Keely bought me many years ago with an inscription that [reads], ‘Time flies on love’s wings,'” Brosnan shared with Entertainment Tonight in October 2022. “I decided to wear it for this character. It seemed appropriate.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Smith, for her part, gushed over her husband’s sweet tribute, saying, “I love those emblems, that he took those with him into the superpower, superhero realm.”</p><p>Scroll on for photos of Brosnan and Smith’s Met Gala debut:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqiZmr%2BksYybqairnpa7bsPIn5xmo5Waubp5zJqrnKBdnrtursuamqRllKq%2FqrrGZpuemqWpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
