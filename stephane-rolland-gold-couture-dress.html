It's fun to consider what the nominees will wear, but maybe even more fun to think about how those who were snubbed could make a dramatic entrance. Surely they're all enlightened souls who aren't thinking about anything as petty as a revenge dress—but what if they are? A suggestion: Consider turning heads in the phenomenal Stéphane Rolland gold dress that debuted on the couture runway yesterday in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was the finale look, appearing like liquid gold frozen mid-pour, gushing out from the model's shoulders and creating a glistening cloqué lamé tent to shield her from the mortals in the front row. A teardrop cut was carved out at the center for her face and a sliver of torso, reminding everyone she was ethereal but still earthly. Gold bangles twisted around her arms like wire. She was the heavenly sculpture of a god come to life. The Oscar statuette could, quite frankly, never, ever.</p><img alt="paris, france january 24 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the stephane rolland haute couture spring summer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on january 24, 2023 in paris, france photo by peter whitegetty images" title="Stephane Rolland : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023" width=3419 height=5128 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674674063.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This particular look was inspired by Brazil's patron saint, Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida, whose original image is enshrined in the central high altar in Aparecida, Brazil. In the show notes, Rolland wrote that the look was meant to represent the conquistadors’ gold bursting in the rising sun's light. He wanted to represent spiritual women, “dressed from the Bahia churches’ baroque.” And it appears that perhaps Rolland did have his mind on the Oscars after all, since he said that the entire collection was inspired by Marcel Camus's Oscar-winning Orfeu Negro, a 1960 adaptation of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, set in a favela in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a42619980/schiaparelli-paris-couture-kylie-jenner-lion-dresses/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Schiaparelli's lion head dress" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Schiaparelli's lion head dress</a> divided the internet after setting it on fire, Rolland's gold gown appeared the very next day and seemed to unify every online person around the idea that the look was divine. It was a representation of what couture should be, the type of ensemble with an unfathomable beauty you couldn't have pictured in your wildest imagination but when you see it, you're so overcome all you can say is “whoa.”</p><img alt="paris, france january 24 a model walks the runway during the stephane rolland haute couture springsummer 2023 fashion show as part of the paris haute couture week on january 24, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Stephane Rolland - Runway - Spring/Summer 2023 Paris Haute Couture Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674677627.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="paris, france january 24 nieves alvarez walks the runway during the stephane rolland haute couture springsummer 2023 fashion show as part of the paris haute couture week on january 24, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Stephane Rolland - Runway - Spring/Summer 2023 Paris Haute Couture Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674677595.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Stéphane Rolland</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There were plenty of other Stéphane Rolland looks from the collection that are worthy of a “whoa.” Like a long brown jersey crepe dress, with draping reminiscent of the drooping petals of a dying flower held together by lapis at the neck. Or a hooded golden lamé crepe dress with amethysts falling like a lei at the chest. And we can only hope to see any of them at the Oscars, ideally for revenge (Viola Davis, are you reading?)—but we'll gladly take them for victory dressing, too.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Stéphane Rolland Haute Couture 2023</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="stéphane rolland" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/21-1674676885.jpg title="stéphane rolland" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
