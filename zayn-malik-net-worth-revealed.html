But how much is he really worth? According to records filed with Companies House, the star's net worth is approximately £50million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6af310e75b3-zayn-malik-event-z.jpg><p id=eVQgJk2N3ivD data-wc=102>Zayn, real name Zain Javadd Malik, was born on 12 January 1993. Hailing from Bradford, the singer rose to fame after appearing on The X Factor. He first competed alone, but was eliminated in the final round of the competition. Simon Cowell then brought Zayn back to the show with four other contestants who eventually became his One Direction band mates - <a class=hm-link href=#>Niall Horan</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Harry Styles</a>, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson. Although the group didn't win the ITV competition, they finished in third place and have since become the show's greatest achievements. Each member of the band is worth at least an impressive £50million.</p><p id=eukq0Xv6sX5w><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: 1D's Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik mend friendship</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ejut4YUzZfuR data-wc=115>The singers all get royalties from other companies, including Rollcall Touring and PPM. "Almost from the off the boys were extremely canny when it came to matters of the purse," a source close to One Direction previously told the Daily Mail. "They received sound financial advice straight away, and none of them have been reckless with their earnings." The insider added: "The plan was always to get to this situation, and have the freedom to pursue what they really wanted. In ten years' time, they could easily be worth £100 million each. It really is quite incredible." The band has sold ten shares in their company, 1D Media, for over £70million netting them £14million each.</p><h3>When did Zayn leave One Direction?</h3><p id=eOH7ZUOhn-oN data-wc=137>Zayn shocked fans around the world in March 2015 when he confirmed that he had left the pop band after five years. In a statement, Zayn said: "My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band." He added: "I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2035d644f515-zayn-one-direction-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eWPXc95N1Qp0 data-wc=8><strong>The pop star left One Direction in 2015</strong></p><h3>Zayn Malik's solo career</h3><p id=etaR_Ta7ZKh4 data-wc=129>Since leaving the band, Zayn has been focusing on his solo career. But the singer's work was hindered after he pulled out of various gigs around the world due to "anxiety". At the time he released a statement which read: "Dear Fans I have been working over the last three months to overcome my extreme anxiety around major live solo performances. I feel I am making progress but I have today acknowledged that I do not feel sufficiently confident to move forward with the planned show in Dubai in October. I am assured that all tickets will be refunded. I am truly sorry to disappoint you. I hope to see you all soon. Thank you to all my fans who support me globally. With love and respect always, Zayn."</p><p id=eqQwtD8EeWjP><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Zayn Malik opens up about ongoing struggle with anxiety</a></p><p id=eG4QaSPA7Vcw data-wc=71>The singer released his first solo album, Mind of Mine, and debut track, Pillowtalk, in 2016. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 lists. He is now working on his second solo album, which is called Dusk Till Dawn. Zayn also provided the vocals to I Don't Wanna Live Forever in a duet with Taylor Swift on the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker.</p><p id=eFafOsEH_u7Q data-wc=65>Music aside, Zayn has ventured into the world of fashion. In January 2017, the star released a shoe line with Italian footwear designer Giuseppe Zanotti. A month later, he appeared in the Versus (Versace) Spring Summer 2017 campaign alongside model Adwoah Aboah. Zayn was then appointed a creative director for a capsule collection entitled Zayn x Versus, which was available to buy in May 2017.</p><p id=edkacsEsIlhi><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Gigi Hadid shoots Zayn Malik in new Versus Versace campaign</a></p><h3>Who is Zayn Malik dating?</h3><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=efB3hRqcqdYH data-wc=87>Zayn has also been involved in various high-profile relationships since his time on <a class=hm-link href=#>The X Factor</a>. Despite their six-year age gap, the British star dated fellow X Factor contestant Rebecca Ferguson for four months when he was 18. Following their brief romance, Zayn went on to date Little Mix singer <a class=hm-link href=#>Perrie Edwards</a>. The former lovebirds began dating in early 2012 after meeting on The X Factor, and got engaged the following year. They shocked fans in August 2015 when it was revealed that they had chosen to end their engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1315b65a981-perrie-edwards-zayn-malik-z.jpg><p class=MsoNoSpacing style=text-align:center id=eiZJpVvnmEa7 data-wc=8><strong>The singer was previously engaged to Perrie Edwards</strong></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eg-CBd1WPc2M data-wc=97>In 2016, Perrie opened up about her heartbreak in the band's new book, Little Mix: Our World. "After I split with my partner, out of the blue, I had nowhere to go, which was incredibly stressful. For a while I had no idea what to do," she wrote. "I thought about renting but I've got dogs and cats, so that was no good. At the time we were promoting Black Magic, and while I was in America, things really hit me and I panicked. I realised I was homeless. I was crying every day, dreading coming back."</p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=e111yFnWls1g><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Why Zayn Malik didn't accompany girlfriend Gigi Hadid at Met Gala 2017</a></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style=text-align:center id=ehDDEuqLbgAz data-wc=11><strong>Zayn has been dating Gigi Hadid for the past two years</strong></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=e2bfQlFpZlN5 data-wc=150>Zayn's most recent relationship is with American model <a class=hm-link href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>. They first started dating after Zayn approached Gigi at a Victoria's Secret after-show party in New York in November 2015, and the singer recently gave an insight into his life with Gigi. "She helps organize my schedule around seeing her," he told Billboard. "She's in the studio quite a lot. She likes to cook for me and stuff - when I'm here late, she'll come down and bring me food. She's cool." In March, the couple revealed that they had decided to go their separate ways after more than two years together. Zayn told fans that he has a "huge amount of respect and adoration" for his former girlfriend, and asked for privacy at the "difficult" time. However, last month, the stars sparked rumours they were back together as they were pictured sharing a kiss during an outing in New York!</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
