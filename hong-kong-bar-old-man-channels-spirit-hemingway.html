He is believed to have introduced it to this city, at the bar of the old Hongkong Hotel, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">when he visited in 1941</span></a> with his new bride, fellow American journalist and novelist Martha Gellhorn, according to whom he “took to Hong Kong at once”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hemingway died in 1961 but if he were here today it would perhaps please him to know that a Hong Kong bar, inspired by his taste in drinks and named after one of his novels, is now ranked as one of the 10 best in the world.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Old Man</span></a>, in Central, was co-founded in 2017 by bartenders Agung Prabowo, Roman Ghale and James Tamang, and last year went straight into the World’s 50 Best Bars list at No 10, also winning the award for the highest new entry.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bar takes its name from the 1952 Hemingway novel The Old Man and the Sea, which won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The drinks list is short and changes every few months. It is based on what Prabowo, a Hemingway buff who was previously in charge of the bars at the Mandarin Oriental, has learned about his hero’s drinks preferences from read­ing his work and the cocktail literature associated with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to make the bar a tribute to Hemingway, but not just a rum bar because of his history in Cuba. It’s a cocktail bar,” says Prabowo. “I admire Hemingway’s books and his journey through the cocktail culture of his day. The Old Man and the Sea is about perseverance in pursuit of a big fish, which represents a big dream. For me and my partners, that’s what this bar is – our big fish.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wherever he was, Hemingway was keen to try the local cocktail speciali­ties, says Prabowo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Hemingway] lived in Key West, Havana, Pamplona, Paris and Venice and contri­buted a lot to the drinking culture in all those places,” he adds. “In Paris, he liked his White Lady [another Harry’s New York Bar speciality] but in Havana he liked his daiquiri.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/13/bc334986-3f1b-11e9-b20a-0cdc8de4a6f4_972x_134616.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The novelist was introduced to the daiquiri at the Floridita bar and restaurant, in Old Havana, and a life-size statue of him at the bar commemorates his patron­age. Like many stories about the origins of cock­tails – and about Hemingway, who told a few tall ones himself – the details of his first encounter with the drink are not entirely clear. What we do know is that Hemingway, who in the latter part of his life suffered from diabetes, did not like sweet drinks, and that the daiquiri – which was first made in Cuba at the end of the 19th century – contained a significant amount of sugar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Prabowo, Hemingway sampled the drink and said he liked it but would prefer it with no sugar and twice as much alcohol. Thus was born the daiquiri variant today called the Papa Doble.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are three kinds of daiquiri. The classic daiquiri, which is rum, fresh lime juice and sugar; the Hemingway daiquiri, which is rum, a little grapefruit juice, maraschino cherry liqueur [replacing the sugar] and fresh lime juice; and the Papa Doble, which is similar to the Hemingway daiquiri but with double the alcohol,” says Prabowo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Old Man’s Hemingway daiquiri is a permanent fixture on the list, and Prabowo’s version stays true to its Havana origins in using white rum distilled in Cuba.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/13/48fc0672-3f18-11e9-b20a-0cdc8de4a6f4_972x_134616.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was originally made with Bacardi rum from the distillery in Havana, but now Bacardi comes from Puerto Rico, so we use Havana Club,” he explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We follow the classic Hemingway dai­quiri recipe – two ounces of rum, ¼ ounce of grapefruit juice, one tiny barspoon­ful of [Luxardo] maraschino, and fresh lime juice – shaken. I put in a little protein powder or egg white, just enough for a little more foam and texture, and we garnish it with grated grapefruit zest. The grapefruit and limes are always freshly squeezed. That makes a big difference. And Hemingway liked his cocktails cold, so it comes in a chilled glass.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Papa would no doubt have approved of the chiller strip that runs the length of The Old Man’s bar counter, and probably also of most other aspects of the place. There’s no statue of him, but a mosaic of the great man made from bar construction waste looks down over drinkers from the service end of the room.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Notwithstanding Hemingway’s endorse­ment, the dry daiquiri did not catch on in the same way as the dry martini, but The Old Man’s, with its refreshing bitter tang and a subtle aroma of grapefruit from the zest floating on the foam, makes a persu­asive case for the idea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For sweeter takes on the drink, Soirée, on Elgin Street, is a daiquiri specialist and The Iron Fairies, on Hollywood Road, is known for its watermelon daiquiri.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOn6aonF2Zv6q6ymiYq6yZmLmme5JpZ2psaGZ8qbvNoGSkp56ceqOt0WampZxdoq6vecKhmKemlaHAbr%2FPoqmirF2dsq61zaCumrE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
