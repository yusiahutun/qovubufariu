"I say that only for you people that hurt also, like I get it."&nbsp;</p><p id=e4OrwqlIlDZ data-wc=36>She carried on that this is partly due to ageing, because when you get older it hurts and "you have to stretch" - except the <a class=hm-link href=#>Legally Blonde</a> actress struggles to stretch due to her Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</p><p id=e7YtZjfQnDJ data-wc=54>"The Ehlers-Danlos - which is something so many more people have now than I realized…" she explained. "Like your muscles just aren't as stable, so the Ehlers-Danlos will make me really really really stiff because I'll pull my muscles too easily and then they're like slack and sit there so I get some injuries."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCFk6HoTsy6 data-wc=21>This might sound incredibly painful and heartbreaking, but according to Selma "this is nothing that's like, horrible, scary stuff or anything".&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Selma Blair opens up about ‘chronic’ health issues</figure><p id=eXQEEvou9vu data-wc=40>She added: "It's just one of those extra things that turns into a chronic thing that you have to watch, because people think stretching is so good for you and I'm technically not allowed to stretch because I'm always stretching."</p><p id=eNP2k0sLTI5 data-wc=26>Selma went on to update fans on her MS, stating it's "fine" and she's "still in remission", but she's due for another MRI and blood work.&nbsp;</p><p id=ee3H9RulB0H data-wc=21>"But I seem to be doing fine and this helps so much", she said, gesturing towards a piece of medical equipment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/621e8215d410-gettyimages-1708672863.jpg><p id=e8I6fxj5WyK data-wc=36>While many people may not know much about multiple sclerosis, one of the few prominent details about it is that often people who have it struggle to walk. Selma revealed her own journey towards walking more.&nbsp;</p><p id=eu6e62iguTE data-wc=46>"If I'm by myself, I do move and walk better", she confirmed. "And in open space. But still I notice when I go out it's still very pronounced when I go into different rooms, hallways or meeting new people or even focusing on talking about it."</p><p id=e4XtNJpnI-w data-wc=24>But she revealed she doesn't mind talking about how strange this can be now since speaking to other people with MS and neurological issues.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef5487876ea7-gettyimages-1447285047.jpg><p id=eBa5s_AWUeR data-wc=28>One particularly heartbreaking admission from the actress was that she gets sad when people ask her what she wants to do with her life because she's so tired.</p><p id=ekY6Ka9NAgs data-wc=53>"I just want to sleep and then get on my horse and be better. I'm a beginner every day, so it's like Groundhog Day, and I'm doing really well - there's no complaining" she explained. "But I don't know if I'll ever have the coordination, or balance, or stamina that I want to."</p><p id=eHsMIzEl2UO data-wc=14>Despite this, Selma confirmed she's "still lucky, still grateful", but "it's still a bummer".&nbsp;</p><p id=eHN12qg48DcZ data-wc=28>Selma's confessions about the current state of her health struck a particular chord with people who also have MS and Ehlers-Danlos, as well as other people with disabilities.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Celebrities who have bravely spoken about MS: Christina Applegate, Selma Blair and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d3c483e54140-celebs-with-ms-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Celebrities who have bravely spoken about MS: Christina Applegate, Selma Blair and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Celebrities who have bravely spoken about MS: Christina Applegate, Selma Blair and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eYraYyCQxxNF data-wc=26>"I hope this becomes a series", one person wrote.
