The song explores the struggle of transitioning from lovers to friends, and how difficult it can be to maintain a healthy relationship with someone you have such a deep history with. It delves into the complexities of dealing with emotions, pride, and the desire for both closeness and distance.One standout lyric in the song is, "We done came too far for this, I'm so tired of arguing." This lyric represents the exhaustion that can come from repeatedly engaging in arguments and conflicts within a relationship. It emphasizes the idea that there comes a point where both parties may feel drained and disinterested in continuing the cycle of disagreement.Another important lyric is, "We spent too long in heaven that we felt the elevation." This lyric implies that the relationship was once a blissful and happy place, but it eventually reached a breaking point where it became unbearable. It suggests that the intense heights of their love ultimately led to their downfall.The line, "Don't pour water on fire," signifies the desire to rekindle the passion and intensity that once existed between the two individuals. This lyric suggests that even if the romantic love is gone, there is still a desire for the sparks and excitement that the relationship once had.Furthermore, the lyric, "I don't gotta be in love with you, to love you," explores the idea that love can take many different forms. It challenges the conventional notion that love is solely tied to romantic feelings and highlights the potential for love to exist in a platonic friendship as well. It suggests that despite the end of their romantic relationship, there is still deep care and affection for the person involved.Overall, the song's themes revolve around the complexities of transitioning from romantic partners to friends, dealing with emotional exhaustion, longing for past happiness, and redefining the meaning of love. It explores the fragile and nuanced dynamics of relationships, encouraging listeners to reflect on their own experiences and the challenges they may face in maintaining connections with those they were once romantically involved with. The remix of "Ex" provides a thought-provoking and relatable perspective on the complexities of love and friendship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyttctmmZqaqWS6pq3NoqWgZZ%2BbeqbEjKWgpWWSlq%2B6edGepKKwXZfGbrjIpWSbmZKu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
