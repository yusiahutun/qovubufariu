This special event marked Lola’s first red carpet walk with her mom since the 2017 New Jersey Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in May. <strong>Watch the video below to see the stunning photos of Kelly and Lola!</strong></p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Kelly and her husband of 21 years, <a href=#>Mark Consuelos,</a> welcomed Lola in June 2001. The longtime duo is also parents to two sons, Michael, 20, and Joaquin, 14. How sweet that Kelly decided to have a girl’s night — Mark, Michael, and Joaquin were probably so jealous!</p><p>We’re so glad Kelly and Lola made up, considering the Live With Kelly and Ryan star recently shared that she really upset her daughter after sharing a #TBT Halloween photo of her on social media without getting permission.</p><p>“I’m never allowed to post a photo of her — ever,” she said to Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on The Tonight Show. “I was like, ‘You know what? She can’t get mad at an eight-year-old photo. It’s a Halloween throwback Thursday.'” But then, her phone rang — and it was Lola. “I was debating [answering],” she laughed. “I was like, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t answer it… but what if it’s an emergency?'”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Wishing you a LIT holiday season!

My friends follow you for some reason and they will see this!’ I was like, ‘You know what? I will take it down. I’ll take it down for you.’ And that was the end of the discussion,” Kelly added. Too funny!</p><p>Apparently, it’s a running joke in their house now. Kelly shared a family photo on Saturday, December 16, for the <a href=#>holidays</a> and added a super funny caption. “Wishing you a LIT holiday season!
