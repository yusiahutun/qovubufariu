I used the brand’s acne line (cleansers, spot treatments, moisturizers and all) consistently throughout high school, and fiercely loved it. My skin was wholly more clear and smooth back then than it is now in my mid-20s, which oddly seems backwards. Therefore, when news of its revamped acne collection landed in my inbox, I questioned why I ever stopped use.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>As I’m sure you can guess, I began again. <a href=#>Burt’s Bees’ Clear & Balanced Collection</a> is designed to treat active breakouts, restore healthy-looking skin and defend against future breakouts with its six product line-up, and I wanted to try it all. After coming off a failed five month stint of <a href=#>tretinoin applications</a>, I was ready to give something less harsh a shot at remedying my constant breakouts.</p><p>The line offers a complete regimen, though in my opinion, adding in even just one product into your daily routine can make a difference. It consists of a <a data-pmc-sp-product=d5aa65da82138fadf445d99cdc8ebb37 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Deep Cleansing Acne Scrub","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Burt\u2019s Bees Clear and Balanced Deep Cleansing Acne Scrub, Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment with Cica, Facial Cream Exfoliator Helps Unclog Pores and Reduce Acne, 4 Oz","price":"9.99","id":"B0027TY3T6","category":"Subscribe & Save Prime Promo"},"id":1601747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Deep Cleansing Acne Scrub</a> , <a data-pmc-sp-product=44152c19b0e61d104ebdee23d7926fcf href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Herbal Blemish Stick","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Burt&#39;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick, 0.26 Fl Oz (Pack of 2), Tea Tree Oil Infused, Soothing, Exfoliating, Cleansing, Unisex","price":"15.68","id":"B001E6Q9IG","category":"Masks"},"id":1601747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Herbal Blemish Stick</a> (my personal favorite), Even Tone Liquid Exfoliant, <a data-pmc-sp-product=ceeeb7bfc9c49ed534a374e32d9a29e9 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Post-Acne Scar Cream","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Burt\u2019s Bees Post Acne Mark Cream for All Skin Types, Gentle Dark Spot Correcting Cream for Face, Formulated with Turmeric, 0.5 Oz.","price":"12.69","id":"B0BXQVH1F3","category":"Face"},"id":1601747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Post-Acne Scar Cream</a> , <a data-pmc-sp-product=c89cdde5bf9765b33127b0b78794ef29 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Breakout Defense Foaming Wash","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Burt\u2019s Bees Foaming Face Wash, BHA Breakout Defense Cleanser for All Skin Types, Washes Away Impurities & Excess Facial Oil, With a Prebiotic, 8 Oz.","price":"9.99","id":"B0BXQHQJS3","category":"Face"},"id":1601747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Breakout Defense Foaming Wash</a> and a <a data-pmc-sp-product=f479ef18980a9da9392769689db7d25e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Skin Balancing Gel Cream","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Burt\u2019s Bees Daily Gel Cream , Skin Balancing Face Moisturizer, Hydrates Skin, for All Skin Types, With a Prebiotic, 1.8 Oz.","price":"13.31","id":"B0BXQW57KX","category":"Face"},"id":1601747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Skin Balancing Gel Cream</a> . While that may sound like a lot to throw at your skin at once, these formulas lean on skin-friendly, natural ingredients that offer less harsh effects compared to more potent acne treatments out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/herbal-blemish-stick.jpg><p>As I pointed out above, my go-to from the collection has easily been the Herbal Blemish Stick. Formulated with tea tree oil, juniper oil, willow bark and calendula, it gently (emphasis on gently!!) treats unwanted spots fast. The rollerball design makes it easy to apply across my skin, and within hours (yes, hours) any massive spots have severely calmed down. I religiously use it morning and night, and have yet to experience irritation or peeling.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the collection is worth trying, too; after consistently using the line for a couple of weeks, I can safely say I like it all. The scrub melts away any dry patches on my skin without leaving it feel stripped of its natural oils, and the foaming wash and daily moisturizer have been keeping my skin balanced and in check, while helping bring a noticeable decrease in breakouts. The products also play well with other brand formulas, so if you don’t want to forgo your current loves in place of these, you don’t have to. I still lean on additional ingredients, like salicylic acid (Note: the scrub does contain this exfoliant) and a mild form of retinol, without any issues.</p><p>The <a href=#>Burt’s Bees Clear & Balanced Collection</a> is available at Amazon (with the exception of the toner exfoliant, which can be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">purchased at Target</a>.) Price points are incredibly affordable, which is another reason why I will always have a soft spot for the brand. <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>Shop</a> them all and watch your skin clear up like mine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bb-gel-cream.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bb-scar-cream.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bb-foaming-wash.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/burts-bees-scrub-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/burts-bees-exfoliant.jpg><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2Bd3yQcGtwZ5Kqv7W%2FjJucnqtdmLmmrdFmmZqkkaOwprCMnKalpJWYwaq7zWapnq6ZmsRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
