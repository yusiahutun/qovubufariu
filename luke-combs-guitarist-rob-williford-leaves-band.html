The musician and songwriter, who helped pen some of Combs' biggest hits, announced his decision to leave the superstar's touring band on social media on Wednesday (Feb. 15).</p><p>In his announcement post, Williford&nbsp;makes it clear that his decision to leave&nbsp;has nothing to do with any negative feelings between himself and his road family — he&nbsp;says&nbsp;that he&nbsp;is "simply starting a new chapter in life," after years of touring with Combs' band.</p><p>"I always knew that I would just know — and I know — it's time. That doesn't make it one bit easier," he reflects in a lengthy statement. "I am equally as terrified of the future as I am excited for it."</p><p>Williford&nbsp;explains&nbsp;that he's planning to devote all his time and energy to writing and producing moving forward.</p><p>"No I'm not going out on my own. No I'm not pursuing a career as an artist. And no, I'm not doing Liberty Mutual commercials," the guitarist jokes.</p><p>In addition to providing&nbsp;these updates, he also took some time to thank the fans who came out to all Combs' shows, his bandmates and — of course — his tour boss.</p><p>"Through the good, the bad and ugly of this surreal simulation I sometimes feel like I'm living in, one person has always had my back. A brother in the truest sense of the word," Williford writes. "Luke, I owe you so much, man. There are no words. I could never thank you enough for your loyalty and your friendship and for allowing me to part of your journey over the years."</p><p>Although Williford won't be joining Combs when the country superstar heads out on his 2023 World Tour this spring, his decision to part ways with Combs' band isn't entirely a goodbye — the two friends are planning to continue co-writing music. Williford has been a collaborator on a number of Combs' hits, including "Beautiful Crazy," which won Song of the Year at the 2019 CMA Awards. They also co-wrote "Forever After All," which was nominated for that same award in 2021 and won Song of the Year at the 2022 BMI Awards.</p><p>"We have another Song of the Year to write soon," Williford promises&nbsp;the star in his post. "I love you. Thank you for believing in me."</p><p>In the comments section of Williford's post, Combs&nbsp;admits that his longtime bandmate's words left him a little emotional.</p><p>"God dang, that one got me," Combs says. "Love you too buddy. We got plenty of songs and memories ahead of us too."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Pictures: Luke Combs Performs at the 2023 Grammy Awards</h2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Combs</a> performed his song "Going, Going, Gone" at the 2023 Grammy Awards.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmafpZ7Bor7IrKtmqp%2BXeri1y6Wgn6eimXqtscCvnKxlkpa7pXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
