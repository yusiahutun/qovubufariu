Out of all the incredible cast, including Cush Jumbo and James Nesbitt, it is Richard who has the most experience in Harlan's world, having previously starred in the hit adaptation . <strong>Ahead of the show's New Year's Eve release, we chatted to him about the show, his character transformation, and what he will be doing to see in the New Year…</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eeGlVgEHxrqM data-wc=14><strong>WATCH: Our guest editor Martine chats all things festive (and drama!) with Richard Armitage</strong></p><h3><strong>You're diving straight into the action in the first episode, but it's all so mysterious! What was your first reaction to the script?</strong></h3><p id=eP--BLbUWFO- data-wc=52>I got the book! [Producers] called me and said, has done really well, do you want to work with us again? Here's the idea, here's the book.' <strong>There was no script, I only had the book. And Harlan Coben is so easy to read, you just can't put it down.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f5447aed888-the-stranger-richard-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=euH1YibJ4pcO data-wc=6><strong>Richard previously starred in The Stranger</strong></p><p id=e_qplTkY1dXj data-wc=54>My first question was, 'Is the character going to be different enough from the one I've just done, because I didn't want to show up doing the same thing,' but they were aware of it as well. They were like, 'It's a different character, he's going to look different, he's going to feel different.'</p><p id=eKSnKaKe33K0 data-wc=46>I just love the themes that Harlan plays with, identity and reinventing yourself and your past catching up with you and how do you hide yourself? <strong>It's people's fantasy and worst nightmare that they try to invent themselves and the past comes back to haunt them.</strong></p><h3><strong>And because the character was so different, you didn't have any doubts at all?</strong></h3><p id=e9tXAcipaj9p data-wc=60>Not at all, because the way that the writers and producers work is that they're so democratic that they say 'yes' to everything, and they're really open to ideas and suggestions. The whole thing about Ray having tattoo sleeves was an invention because I wanted to give him a very different visual identity which was different to the previous character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8e0c3973807-stay-close-richard-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyZGuqBEyI9K data-wc=7><strong>In the new show, Richard plays Ray</strong></p><p id=e-mqg2Hjmt8n data-wc=37>I wanted him to map his lost memory in visual form, and they were like,<strong> 'Great, let's do it!' To have producers and writers that go with ideas like that is brilliant, you know what it's like!</strong></p><h3><strong>It's so much fun when they embrace what you feel in your heart. How long did you film for?</strong></h3><p id=eKyuQe25Q38O data-wc=68>It was for about seven months which is quite luxurious for television. They do it well, they spend the money, they make sure the locations are brilliant.&nbsp;<strong>I do collect a lot of stuff early on in preparation that will sustain me through the shoot. I always build a soundtrack so if I've been away for a week, I'll use music to get myself back into the vibe.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f42f58cfa9df-james-nesbitt-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enupivEy-gRR data-wc=4><strong>James Nesbitt also stars</strong></p><p id=eUMr4IDb6fYH data-wc=86>I studied a photographer called Tim Hetherington as the base for who the character was, so I had a collection of ideas of who he was in the past. It kept me going through the seven months but going back and working with that crew again was just so brilliant. For me, it's all about the crew, those mates that you love working with. And the pandemic was tough on people, because we were all kept apart, so it was so nice to see everybody again.</p><h3><strong>You've got this whole new character with a crew that you trust. How long did that transformation take? Like your tattoos! How long did it take each morning?</strong></h3><p id=ekLmnpqm69lW data-wc=58>We managed to figure out with costume department how much of the tattoos you'd see so that most of the time I only had to do my hands because I was wearing long sleeves. We really tried to keep it to a minimum of how many times you'd see the whole thing because that took about two hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93b2dc6b3ddb-richard-camera-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ek8PpjF1j0zO data-wc=10><strong>The new drama will be out on New Year's Eve</strong></p><p id=emv7UkWpwV9T data-wc=86>And sometimes they would have to throw them on in the middle of the day. And I remember the makeup designer pulling our hair out and being like, 'Well, why did we decide to do this?' We did limit it a little bit, but it's fun to do a transformation because the character was using his hands a lot, you'd see the camera in front of his face. <strong>I just thought let's have something really interesting, in his hands, just to distract from my face! [Laughs]</strong></p><p id=eofNXYYimTtZ data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ralf Little reveals secrets of Death in Paradise's first Christmas special</a></strong></p><p id=eJelHdDUHsNL data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Martine McCutcheon's top 10 festive film and TV recommendations</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Are there going to be the usual epic twists?</strong></h3><p id=e0wXCJEL4DjK data-wc=34>Yes! And it is different from the book. He really expands some of the characters and some of the relationships and it gets darkly comedic in places, but there are some big twists coming.</p><h3><strong>Wow. And do you think with this one, there could be a second series? And if so, would you like to be involved again?</strong></h3><p id=eii_sZYp5D8t data-wc=47>Had you asked me that about I would have said yes, you probably could do a second season but with I think it's closed in the end. It's so final. There is an open-ended unresolved thing that happens, the big event is revealed!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fccf3d6a008b-the-stranger-richard-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ey7SmdBq38cS data-wc=9><strong>Unlike The Stranger, Stay Close has a firm conclusion</strong></p><h3><strong>Has it been one of your favourite parts to play?</strong></h3><p id=ezTeYHoymGVZ data-wc=53>One of the biggest challenges was playing a character that doesn't remember anything. When a writer is trying to write a lack of memory, and they're putting them into a police interview situation, it's a dead end every time a question is asked, because the answer is, 'I don't know. I don't remember.'</p><p id=etBgzEUAlnm1 data-wc=52><strong>We had to play around with, what happens when you don't remember something, you either admit that you don't remember? </strong>Or you lie, or you invent? And I thought that was what was interesting for me, he was almost kidding himself. He'd created a past for himself, which was not the truth.</p><h3><strong>Do you think he did that to be able to live with himself or for other means?</strong></h3><p id=eJbsexw_6x_y data-wc=57>It's a bit of both, I think you can't live with a vacuum behind you, you must create a memory where one doesn't exist. But the problem with Ray is that he's created a false memory of something traumatic. He's almost admitting guilt to something that he has no memory of which I think was a challenge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28565d503688-stay-close-poster-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e69Hi0FJ7pvk data-wc=5><strong>Will you be tuning in?</strong></p><h3><strong>It's so complex and so lovely to investigate and play and the show is landing on Netflix on New Year's Eve? What are you doing for New Year's Eve?</strong></h3><p id=eaM6p9C5Ccoq data-wc=103>I will be watching fireworks at the bottom of a mountain in Park City, and on New Year's Day it's a tradition which I've had to dispense with because of COVID, but I I usually start the year at the top of the mountain and ski down. And I do it because I was so sick of waking up with a really bad hangover and feeling a little bit depressed.<strong> I decided to start the new year on a high, get to the top of a mountain, breathe the air, and just start with really good intentions. So that's what I'll be doing.</strong></p><p id=eiVvQSF7-6Ai data-wc=13>I've waited for too many night buses in the rain, it's not fun!</p><h3><strong>It's not glamorous. It's not fun. And I don't know why it's almost like you erase your memory of how bad it is!&nbsp;Like your character! [Laughs] Christmas, hopefully this one won't be cancelled this year. Are you a big Christmas fan? Are you a bit bah, humbug? How do you feel about it this year?</strong></h3><p id=e0JpgegEcn0l data-wc=66>You'll probably relate to this as an actor is that I tend to give Christmas over to everybody else because I've spent so much of the year away from friends and family. So I just give it over. So I go to see my brother, go to see my dad and do whatever they want to do. But it's usually the same as the year before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73befbe1c701-richard-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e77jPjO4-kCY data-wc=6><strong>Richard previously starred in&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 style=-webkit-text-stroke-width:0;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;margin-top:0;text-align:start><strong>And do you have any traditions in the Armitage household? Are there any little traditions that you always do?</strong></h3><p style=-webkit-text-stroke-width:0;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;margin-top:0;text-align:start id=eHiXirIH8BZm data-wc=94>My brother has picked up this tradition that we have with kids. And I'm pretty sure it happens in every single household which is just leaving out a little plate of carrots&nbsp;and a glass of sherry for Santa. He does it with his kids, and the game is that he'll try and drink the sherry before because they won't go to bed! They'll come back in and be like, 'The sherry's gone, has he already been?' and we'll be like, 'It's like oh no, mummy just had that. Let's top it up again.'&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>I'm glad it's not just us! I must finally ask, as the wonderful storyteller that you are, what is your favourite go-to Christmas movie? And why?</strong></h3><p id=eIs5Mwa5jrH9 data-wc=41>That is a tough one. It's probably going to be Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's not a Christmas film is it but if it's on, I will watch it, and it's usually Christmas Day. That, or Watership Down.</p><p id=ebxMBn9HnCpn data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
