He is driving with his dad, Jim, on an approximately 2,000-mile road trip that started in Albuquerque—the chef’s hometown—to put together his annual New Mexican Chile Roast, taking place four days later at the Meat Hook butcher shop in Brooklyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This marks the fourth year See has embarked on the quest to transport chiles directly from New Mexico to Brooklyn. In his home state, the annual green chile festival has been celebrated since the early 1970s. His version, which he describes as “a sensory cultural experience,” honors his heritage, the history of the chile, and queerness with joy and familial warmth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time I’ve gotten a hold of See, he is passing through Dallas with 1,400 pounds of green chiles in tow from the Viramontes Farm in Deming, New Mexico. The Sees keep the AC maxed out, creating a makeshift highway refrigerator on wheels. The New Mexican green chile harvest is regional and seasonal—people buy chiles by the pound in ziplock or large trash bags, have them roasted (if they weren’t already), and then sit around the kitchen table together to peel them still warm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Green chiles are an integral part of New Mexicans’ cultural identity; the pepper was born there, a creation of horticulturist Fabían García’s. New Mexicans tuck the chiles into burritos and gorditas, cook them down into stews, layer them in burgers, and so on. And at See’s restaurant Ursula—where most of the menu offerings boast green chile—they’re even made into a jam spread in the restaurant’s toothsome “sangwiches.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For this year’s event, he invited <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/bleuadams/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bleu Adams" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Bleu Adams</u></a>, a Mandan-Hidatsa-Diné chef of Southwestern cuisine and director of the organization <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.indigehub.org data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Indigehub class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Indigehub</u></a>, to fly in from Provo, Utah. The two met at a James Beard boot camp to teach chefs about addressing issues like food systems, restaurant labor, and wages at the federal level, Adams tells me. After they met, See says, he instantly knew he wanted to cook with her.

Here’s a peek behind the chile smoke at the preparation for this special event.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>9:30 a.m., Tuesday, September 5</strong></h2><img alt="andrea aliseda" title="andrea aliseda" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1951-65048e9a03dcd.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrea Aliseda</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today is the big day, the culmination of what ended up being a six-day road trip to bring some authentic New Mexico to Brooklyn. The day begins, naturally, with roasting chiles in barrel roasters. To my surprise, they aren’t Hatch chiles—one of the most popular varieties from New Mexico. See says that Hatch chiles are one of the state’s 12 regional varieties; his are machete (spicy!) and Big Jim (less spicy). On the first roasting shift are Elihu Jones, Nicky Yeager, and Tori Canning, who eventually begins packaging the produce. Roasting the chiles is necessary because, as See explains, their outer skin is plasticky and not palatable. But it causes them to lose water weight, so five pounds of fresh chiles weigh 3.9 pounds after roasting. They are sold in ziplock bags, in tradition with standard New Mexico practices.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>1:30 p.m.</strong></h2><img alt="ursula brooklyn chile roast" title="ursula brooklyn chile roast" width=4032 height=3024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1923-65048ec825425.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrea Aliseda</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I turn the corner of Brooklyn’s Graham Avenue, my nose knows I’ve arrived before my eyes do. The street is perfumed with a toasty vegetal waft, laced with a hint of spice from the chiles roasting in the barrels. The temperature is high in the 90s, and the air is swirling with charred bits of chile, a charcoal rain that we’re all instantly freckled by.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>1:41 p.m.</strong></h2><img alt="ursula brooklyn" title="ursula brooklyn" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-2027-65048f2950ae7.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrea Aliseda</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I catch up with See, he is carving kernels off of corncobs for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022139-esquites data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=esquites class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">esquites</a>. He talks about horticulturist García’s impact on New Mexican cuisine and the green chile (pronounced “chili” in New Mexico). García worked to cultivate a chile that would peel more easily, be more suitable for canning, and, See says, appeal more to American palates—i.e., be less spicy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Matador, the variety See uses for his green chile burgers, is a genetic child of the chile García would develop: New Mexico No. 9. Sounds like the name of a perfume.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">See says this year, the matador chiles were smaller. The increasingly hot temperatures (hello, climate change) in New Mexico this year stressed the plants, causing them to produce more capsaicin than normal and stunting their growth.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>2:48 p.m.</strong></h2><img alt="ursula brooklyn" title="ursula brooklyn" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1940-65048fc8ca22a.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrea Aliseda</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Twenty-two bags out of 40 have been roasted and bagged.
