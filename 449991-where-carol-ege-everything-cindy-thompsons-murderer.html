However, there was no evidence linking him to the brutal act. On the night when the incident occurred, he was at Carol's <a href=#>house</a> drinking.</p><p class=align-left>Carol was also interrogated after mutual friends informed the police of her hatred for Cindy.

Finally, in the early 90s, police found a bruise on Cindy's cheek that was established as a bite mark. They tested several friends and family members through forensics and established a 3.5 million to one probability that Carol Ege made the bite mark. She was charged with first-degree murder in 1993.</p><p class=align-left>Further investigations confirmed Sanders as the killer, including testimony from Richard Lgnau who had accompanied her on the night she attacked Thompson. She was to part with $350 for him to kill Cindy, but the plan backfired.</p><p class=align-left>In 1987, police gathered physical evidence against Ege. Her ex-boyfriend informed police that she had stored a hammer and a knife with a broken tip in his storage locker. Investigators believe that the bent knife was due to an injury to Cindy's spinal cord.</p><p class=align-left>On January 28, 1994, Carol Ege was sentenced to life without parole after being found guilty of murder.
