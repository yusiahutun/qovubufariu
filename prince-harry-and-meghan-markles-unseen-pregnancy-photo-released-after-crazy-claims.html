But now, photographer, Misan Harriman has now denied the ‘crazy’ allegations.</strong></p><p>The famous photo in question was the announcement for their second child, Princess Lilibet. In the picture, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> can be seen under a huge tree, which the Daily Mail claimed was not actually the case. The photographer has now released the original photo in his defense.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-photographer-who-took-meghan-markle-s-pregnancy-photo-calls-claims-crazy>Photographer who took Meghan Markle’s pregnancy photo calls claims ‘crazy’</h2><p>Taking to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> after false claims he ‘admitted’ to doctoring the pregnancy announcement, Misan posted a video, denying the allegations further.</p><p>The claims made by the publication said the photographer had ‘admitted’ to doctoring the image of trees and meadows on a BBC 3 podcast called Private Passions.</p><p>“This is crazy,” he said before playing the segment, and what he actually said.</p><p>“Yeah they were lost in their love, at home, in their garden, comfortable, celebrating new joy,” Harriman said at the time.</p><p>In his social media video, the 46-year-old explained that they were discussing the technology he had used during lockdown. The photograph, released in 2021 was taken virtually, via special technology from his iPad. He then said he was asked some “leading questions” beforehand.</p><p>“I get that a lot in regards to <a href=#>Harry and Meghan</a> and I tend to swerve, ignore, try and get back on track, and say what I’m there to say rather than any sort of intrigue and gossip and that’s exactly what happened,” he explained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-he-actually-said>What he actually said</h2><p>In the clip, host Michael Berkeley can be heard asking: “They weren’t actually under a willow tree. They were lying outside in a meadow, weren’t they, Harry and Meghan, when you took a photograph of them?”</p><p>Harriman then responds “no” before explaining: “They were lost in their love at home in their garden, comfortable, celebrating new joy, new life, the fortitude of hoping for life in life after such loss that they went through with the miscarriage. So it really was a particularly joyous image to celebrate life itself.”</p><p>These words were then reported to have been ‘minced’ to make it look like he had edited trees into the photo. He then called the claims made by the publication “insidious and really dangerous journalism,” before confirming the only changes made to the picture was “the black-and-white color grade.”</p><p>“Any mention of meadows and willow trees came out of the person doing the interview. Not my mouth.”</p><p>Misan then released the original colored image on his Instagram, which he captioned: “No trees or meadows were moved or swapped, this is the image straight out of the camera. Also, that is a Jacaranda Tree, not a willow tree.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-apologizes-for-editing-photo-as-theories-fly-around>Kate Middleton apologizes for editing photo – as theories fly around</h2><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> was forced to <a href=#>issue an apology</a> on social media, for editing the picture with her three children.</p><p>“Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,” the 41-year-old began.</p><p>“I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C,” she wrote on the Kensington Palace X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Although many theories have been floating around the internet, including the <a href=#>photo was taken in 2023</a>, sources say the photo was taken last week.</p><p>Kate was pictured in the car with <a href=#>Prince William</a> shortly after her apology, although her face could not be seen.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aBcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZKaZoqC5pr%2BMrqWsnZWjerG%2BxKClmqaTrnqxtM6tpmaqlaGyor%2FEnWSanqSav26v0ZqxsmWToa6qudJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
