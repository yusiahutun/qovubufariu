But he isn’t the only one of the Hemsworth brothers to keep a good fitness routine. Chris, 40, frequently talks about keeping up with his athleticism, so it’s no surprise his siblings also go to the gym. The place in which Luke was exercising could have been the home gym the three brothers have called the Iron Temple. He has previously explained they work “incredibly hard” to stay fit.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-shares-a-gym-snap-to-welcome-in-the-new-year>Luke shares a gym snap to welcome in the New Year</h2><p>The 43-year-old posted a topless black-and-white picture of himself in the gym, flexing his muscles as he looks down into the camera.

But it’s not just the brothers who use it, nor is it always a peaceful experience.</p><p>“When Chris first bought his house out here, we set up the most incredible home gym in the world,” he explained. “When we moved I took the whole gym and now it’s all in my garage and it’s fantastic because we get Liam and, like, six people coming over and we work out together.</p><p>“Orlando Bloom was using it for a while, which was cool. It’s become another reason to hang out, and it makes training a lot easier when you’re getting pushed by each other—so that’s the wonderful part.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star continued: “We’ve always been competitive. I yell at Liam all the time: ‘Move faster! Work harder!’ I’m like the trainer because I design all the workouts and implement and enforce them. Then on top of that, Liam and I are always surfing together, and Chris when he’s here.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Celebrity deaths 2023: Remembering movie and TV icons we lost last year</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2V%2FcK%2FHq6CsZZiaurTDzquroatdm7yzs86tq56mXZe%2FsMDHnqlmqKKWtrSxw2adqKpdrLyzt86uq2aqlajCrcDSZqCnZZeuum68x6irqKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
