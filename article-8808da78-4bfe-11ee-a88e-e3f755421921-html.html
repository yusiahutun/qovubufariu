The Tornadoes carried a lead into the fourth quarter of a sloppy contest that featured more penalty flags than first downs, but three late scores allowed the Tigers to take over and maintain possession of the jug, winning 37-28.</p><p>The Tornadoes (0-2) met adversity early in the evening, with an injury sidelining senior quarterback Kobe Pierce on the second drive of the game, but Laurel’s defense stepped up in a major way to help the team recapture momentum.</p><p>The Tigers’ (1-1) third possession of the evening ended abruptly, with an interception by senior defensive end Arquan Moffett that gave Laurel the ball inside Laurel’s 40-yard line. Moments later, senior running back Brayden Jordan burst through a gap down the middle for a 30-yard touchdown run to give the Tornadoes an early 6-0 lead.</p><p>After another strong showing by the Tornadoes’ defense, Jordan reached paydirt again, this time pushing his way across the goal line from the 3-yard line to double Laurel’s lead. The Tigers’ offense finally got the ball rolling on the ensuing drive, capitalizing on a long kick return to score on a 26-yard pass by junior quarterback Deuce Vance and slice the lead in half, with a 12-6 score heading into halftime.</p><p>Momentum from the previous score propelled Hattiesburg to a strong start in the second half, scoring on a five-play, 58-yard drive to begin the third quarter. Laurel responded with what many believed to be an incredible touchdown reception by senior Anthony Rogers, but another costly penalty resulted in a replaying of the down. Two plays later, Laurel was forced to settle for a field goal by junior John Gonzalez, reclaiming a 15-12 advantage.</p><p>The Tigers responded quickly, scoring on a 72-yard kick return on the following play to claim their first lead of the night. Rogers redeemed himself on the next drive, however, hauling in an equally-impressive touchdown reception to put Laurel back on top 21-18 entering the fourth quarter.</p><p>After nearly forcing the Tigers to punt out of their own end zone, the Tornadoes increased their lead to 28-18 early in the final quarter, this time on a 12-yard scramble by senior backup quarterback Tommaj Harris.</p><figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"><span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle=modal data-target=.modal-ce5c77f0-4bfe-11ee-92bb-b38faaeadeb6><span class="fas tnt-expand"></span></span> <span class=caption-text><p>Laurel senior backup quarterback Tommaj Harris stiff-arms Hattiesburg’s Cameron Craft on a scramble in the fourth quarter of Friday night’s 37-28 loss to the Tigers. <strong>(Photo by Brad Crowe)</strong></p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><p>Again, the Tigers responded quickly, driving down the field in only five plays to score on a 6-yard run by Vance.</p><p>Penalties put the Tornadoes behind the eight ball again on the ensuing drive. With time running low, they were forced to attempt a conversion on fourth-and-32, the failure of which put Hattiesburg’s offense back in possession with a short field. On the third play of the drive, senior Tavares Wade reached the end zone on a 6-yard run. The point-after attempt cemented the Tigers second straight victory in the rivalry by a final score of 37-28.</p><p>The Tornadoes will be back at home Friday night in search of their first win against 3A juggernaut Jefferson Davis County.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMDOq6WanJ%2BawG6ywKWjZqyfYsGqs8SrqmahnmKzra3GZp2eq6RkrrPAyJyjnpdobX15sMBwb2Zskpuybn2QnpxmmWhtsm6xkp9ubm1kZ356fpBnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
