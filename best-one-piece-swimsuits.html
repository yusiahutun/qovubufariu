Think again. The best one-piece swimsuits continue to be a staple that's well worth having in your arsenal, especially as designs are becoming bolder and more exciting. “Novelty embellishments are everything right now — from funky prints to beaded straps, there’s a lot of appetite for swimwear that helps you stand out,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Caroline Maguire</a>, fashion director at Shopbop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, it's easy to see why fashion-forward celebs have been ditching their itty-bitty bikinis in favor of the more modest silhouette. Not only are one-piece swimsuits <strong>extremely flattering</strong> on practically every body type, but you can also layer the versatile pieces under skirts and pants to turn them into a cute top.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>editors individually tested</a> 36 pieces of swimwear on various bodies and during different occasions, including at the pool and engaging in activities like jet skiing and beach volleyball, to see which held up for <strong>comfort</strong>, <strong>support</strong>, <strong>style</strong>, and <strong>coverage</strong>. We also tapped into editor and expert recommendations and product reviews, to find the best pieces for vacations ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-andie-the-amalfi></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Andie The Amalfi</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Andie The Amalfi" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nCBjkLU297ETRmPg-Ta9vwnMcMk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/andie-the-amalfi-6ab60441f0af47efaa963089ab07e23e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the straps being rather thin, they held up our E cups like it was no big feat.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The leg cutout is rather high and shows off a good chunk of your hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once we finally got our hands on this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ultra-flattering one-piece</a>, we never wanted to take it off — seriously, its <strong>shapewear-like fit </strong>made us look that good. We were able to choose between a <strong>smooth, ribbed, and patterned fabric</strong>, among <strong>eleven colors</strong> (and <strong>seven sizes</strong>!), so it was easy to find something that matched our individual tastes. Once on, we were delighted to find that the deceivingly thin, <strong>adjustable straps</strong> held up our E cups like it was nothing. Even while on waterslides (yes, we wore it to an amusement park), this suit <strong>stayed in place </strong>and kept <strong>everything concealed</strong>. It was one of those swimsuits we felt comfortable enough to run around in, eat in, and do more than just lie around and look cute (although we did look cute). Just be aware that the leg cutout does come up a little high. We found it rather flattering, but some might not like the amount of hip that’s being revealed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric didn’t cling to us or feel soggy when it was wet, <strong>retaining its shape</strong> impressively throughout different dryness levels. And because we’re sometimes lazy, we threw this swimsuit in the washer and dryer — something that’s typically taboo. Still, the piece came back out again like new, revealing no damage done through the wash cycle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–3XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 12 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-amazon-essentials-womens-thin-strap-scoop-neck-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Essentials Women's Thin Strap Scoop Neck Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Essentials Women's Thin Strap Scoop Neck Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fgmGdo-Vc7XHWmL190-nWKICyck=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-essentials-womens-thin-strap-scoop-neck-swimsuit-58089015ce97421ea69ecb124648a6a0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> With 11 colors and patterns to choose from and an affordable price, owning more would feel guiltless.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish it had a low back for a bit more sex appeal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a no-frills yet still attractive bathing suit, turn to this Amazon Essentials one-piece, which fits <strong>sizes up to 3X </strong>and comes in <strong>11 colors</strong> and <strong>patterns</strong> to choose from. (We're partial to this lively red leopard print, but knowing that's not everyone's cup of tea, you can't go wrong with any of the solid shades, like terracotta or violet.) The cut gives off more of a swim meet vibe, rather than a sexy day at the beach, so we would've loved to see a low back on it. However, this cut does offer a <strong>lot of support</strong> for those with larger breasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–3X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Padding:</strong> No | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-daci-front-cross-plus-size-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Daci Front Cross Plus Size One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=921 data-sizes=750px alt="Daci Front Cross Plus Size One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1jTbPooBeLgz8G78dd8NmaTVb0s=/fit-in/1500x921/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/daci-f84b55b0d3de4e73ade3522697e65eaa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Adjustable shoulder straps make this a stylish suit that can double as a top.<br><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The front cross straps may move around during wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Daci designs some of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best plus-size one-piece swimsuits </a>we’ve ever tried, and we're obsessed with this stylish <strong>cross-halter</strong> number. The <strong>modern silhouette</strong> features a <strong>ruching along the stomach</strong> and you can tie the halter straps in different ways for a customized look. The crisscross option is so eye-catching that we can see ourselves wearing it under a wrap skirt on nights out this summer. We’re not sure how well the straps will stay put if we’re slipping down water slides, but the affordable price means we’re willing to take the risk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> M–28 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 33 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-busts-mara-hoffman-emma-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Small Busts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mara Hoffman Emma One Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mara Hoffman Emma One Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O6d9lex3isvd8nnnwPM5ORoJXPM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mara-hoffman-emma-one-piece-a6620e37def447c394632328e05142dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mara Hoffman</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The triangle-shaped V-neck flatters small busts and doesn’t cut so deep we’re worried about slippage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish it came in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Mara Hoffman Emma one-piece is not just a suit from a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>legendary designer</a>, it’s a masterpiece, with a <strong>criss-cross back</strong>, <strong>V-cut front</strong>, and<strong> double-layered fabric</strong> that provides smaller busts with plenty of front coverage. The material itself stretches a lot giving us <strong>full mobility</strong> while wearing it. If you have a long torso, you’ll be happy to know that this fits our 5-foot, 9-inch tall body like a glove. We typically struggle to find a one-piece that fits our tall body, but this piece, combined with the <strong>adjustable straps</strong>, made it work like a dream.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the one-piece is constructed with two layers — a textured outer layer and a smooth, seamless inner layer — it felt very substantial, and it’s evident that there’s little chance of it ever being see-through (or weathered down). The fabric also made it more sturdy, never changing in elasticity when wet. It withstood our intense wringing and did not show signs of stretching or damage. We loved it so much that we wished it came in more color options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-trendy-staud-gossamer-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Trendy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Staud Gossamer One Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shopbop Staud Gossamer One Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IpSyDJyV0weTLjr97lI8nAxr4m0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/staud-gossamer-one-piece-6ba8d4e9fde749b995807f843ddbf078.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Delicate details like a structured bodice, bow accents, and ruffled balconette bra send this adorable one-piece over the edge.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The vibrant orange hue may not please everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We implore you to go forth and be bold wearing this <strong>bright, punchy orange-shaded</strong> beauty from Staud, who only<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> launched its swimwear collection</a> a few seasons ago and has already captured our hearts a million times over. Until further notice, we’ll only be envisioning all the places we can get away with parading about in this coquettish daydream of a one-piece swimsuit — it tastefully incorporates trendy details like <strong>miniature bows</strong> and <strong>subtle ruffled lining </strong>for a piece that feels very of-the-moment, but not stuck in time. We can see slipping into it for many seasons beyond this summer thanks to its classic, always in-season elements such as a <strong>corset-fitted bodice</strong>, a <strong>double strapped design</strong>, and a romantic <strong>balconette-style bra top</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | Colors: 1 | Padding: No | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tummy-control-hilor-womens-tummy-control-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tummy Control</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hilor Women's Tummy Control One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hilor Women's Tummy Control One Piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PBIiGBnJtOj6_aNQpWsFW85ufvU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hilor-womens-tummy-control-one-piece-swimsuit-6fe7c68aabef492c8ef011b66d3e4ab9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ruching on the belly combined with the sweetheart neckline creates a very beautiful silhouette.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The material, albeit durable, isn’t all that soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While swimwear isn’t exactly<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> shapewear</a>, some bathing suits offer similar tummy-controlling properties. We found the <strong>ruching</strong> on this swimsuit to not only <strong>disguise our tummies</strong> but also cinch it in to create a beautiful silhouette. Combined with the <strong>criss-cross ruching </strong>on the chest that creates a <strong>sweetheart neckline</strong>, we loved how flattering this swimsuit looked while on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric of this swimsuit wasn’t the softest, but it felt very durable and high-quality, which was a pleasant surprise considering the affordable price. We felt comfortable swimming laps in this, thanks to its supportive grip on the body. And while it is a <strong>full-coverage swimsuit</strong>, it didn’t lack its feminine touch due to how it accentuated our figures. Especially on bustier women, the padding in the bra portion held everything up nicely to show off a well-supported, curvy body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6–18 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-square-neck-stylest-sculpting-square-neck-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Square-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Stylest Sculpting Square Neck Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Stylest Sculpting Square Neck Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-1Gh2Ww1Tb0rQVpyIjeUF_gQaCA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stylest-Sculpting-Square-Neck-Swimsuit-453e7c77d60b43f4b8a1f83a8d090639.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The square neck and built-in bra allow us to feel secure and covered no matter if we’re swimming laps or rushing around in the waves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There’s no padding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can understand why InStyle <span class=ql-cursor></span>Editor-in-Chief <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sally Holmes</a> loves this square-neck suit. At first glance, it may seem simple, but Stylest put a lot of thought into designing every inch of this swimsuit, transforming it into a <strong>one-of-a-kind piece </strong>you truly have to experience for yourself. Let us explain; <strong>built-in shapewear</strong> snatches waists to accentuate curves and turn straight silhouettes into voluptuous hourglass figures. Not to mention, each of the 11 <strong>rich-looking-hued colorways</strong> is stunning (though we’re partial to the captivating sapphire hue that camouflages well into fitting for any oceanic adventure). And, the colors remain vibrant after you’ve subjected it to sand, salt, and sun salty water and hours in the sun thanks to a chlorine and salt-resistant material and UPF 50+ protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the built-in shelf bra is lined we’re not too worried about the lack of padding and padding, either, and it still subtly lifts chests for enhanced support.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–2X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Padding:</strong> No | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-eres-cassiope-bustier-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eres Cassiopée Bustier One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Eres Cassiop&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;e Bustier One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JGUgE6mh49FMM9p-7EXj-R1_a-w=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eres-cassiope-bustier-one-piece-161db4f5222545b39713fe9a44182326.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eres</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The beautiful strapless design serves a luxe and timeless look we’ll never grow tired of wearing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The chest area runs a little small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, we’ve racked up quite the bill buying new swimsuits for our annual sunny-side vacations, until, finally, we threw our hands up and decided to just invest once and for all in a swimsuit that wouldn’t disintegrate after a few pool dips. And, splurging on the Eres one-piece was a total no-brainer: Its <strong>classic silhouette</strong> cinched waists to create the illusion of an hourglass figure and we’re charmed by the <strong>romantic bustier neckline</strong>. (which runs a tad small, FYI). “It's lightweight and quick-drying, and snug in all of the right places,” says InStyle Associate Fashion Commerce Editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hayley Prokos</a>, who shelled out on the suit in the striking and rich-hued Jungle Green colorway for her honeymoon.

It helps that the one-piece also has a<strong> shelf bra</strong> with <strong>built-in cups</strong> for extra support, as well as <strong>built-in compression</strong> to keep everything in place, so consider this a win for your chest and back.

This Cosmo Shoulder One Piece, which we fittingly opted to try in the Mother-Earth-approved green hue, scored high for its <strong>velvety-feeling fabric </strong>and <strong>durability</strong>. While this colorway gorgeously contrasts against the <strong>gold hoop accent</strong> and shows off the <strong>ribbed detailing</strong> more than the other hues, the Twilight shade features a stunning metallic finish that makes it a truly eye-catching piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the fit was remarkable. “I’m tall, but my torso is an awkward length where cutout tops always hit me in weird, ill-fitting spots, but I was thrilled that this one piece sat snugly against my body so no matter how much I twisted and turned it showcased the cheeky, exposed bit of skin as intended by the triangle-shaped design,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a>, an InStyle commerce writer and co-author of this article. Although we’re concerned about how much support the lack of an underwire would provide larger chests, we do appreciate that the sturdy double-strapped design holds up the top half of the bathing suit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-neck-spanx-pique-shaping-high-neck-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Pique Shaping High Neck One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Pique Shaping High Neck One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/35FFuTP_qc_lVMCdq9ojnbTj4Ac=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-pique-shaping-high-neck-one-piece-fedec35f0c154583beb8e17c976816eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With a figure-smoothing fabric and classic design<strong>, </strong>we’re living in the full coverage option in and out of the water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx may be the gold standard for crafting the most figure-flattering, comfiest, and modest clothing that doesn’t look dowdy — its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>butt-flattering pants</a> are life-changing – and its high-neck one-piece defies the notion that full coverage can’t also be chic. A bit of <strong>cheeky coverage</strong> on the backside and <strong>exposed back</strong> give it a bit more of an alluring edge, and one you’ll feel fully confident wearing thanks to Spanx’s signature-shaping technology featured in the <strong>compressed midsection</strong>. It’s easy to jump in and out of, too, thanks to the <strong>easy-to-reach back clasp</strong>. While the deep black shade only does more favors for our figure, we’d be thrilled if we could parade around a couple of punchier hues, and hopefully, Spanx will consider expanding the color options soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Padding: </strong>Removable | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scoop-neck-hanky-panky-ruched-bow-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Scoop-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hanky Panky Ruched Bow One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hanky Panky Ruched Bow One Piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S3ICKQh7OSiCZ97kSnB2EKbK6vg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hanky-panky-ruched-bow-one-piece-swimsuit-20071f73ba664a00aea22c181e451c08.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hanky Panky</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The tie bow details are not only an adorable design accent, but this adjustable feature also allows wearers to manipulate the swimsuit for the best fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You will likely have to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Complete with a <strong>supportive soft scoop neckline</strong> and endearing <strong>bow straps</strong>, we’re beholden to the feminine, and functional, charm that accompanies this sweet little number. “I’m obsessed with how the one-piece has a <strong>seamless</strong> design and is <strong>double-lined</strong> so that it hugs my body and flatters my silhouette for an ultra-sleek look, but not at the sacrifice of showing, well, everything underneath,” says Richardson. Plus, she says its <strong>recycled nylon fabric </strong>is one of the <strong>softest materials</strong> she’s ever experienced from swimwear. “It’s like a mixture between silk and plush cotton,” adds Richardson, who says that trying the swimsuit on just for fun resulted in her hanging around her apartment in it for hours thanks to its loungewear-adjacent feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the swimsuit runs a little large (we found ourselves dealing with a lot of extra fabric on the top half), its adjustable features still keep the top half securely in place.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shapewear-miraclesuit-escape-one-piece-allover-slimming-underwire-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shapewear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Miraclesuit One-Piece Slimming Underwire Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Miraclesuit Escape One-Piece Allover Slimming Underwire Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5a0Em3UvA25BzeDH-nmoWx0P_8U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Escape-One-Piece-Allover-Slimming-Underwire-Swimsuit-9a3f8ca5600b4f97bfee159ef1622c66.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This vintage suit lifts and tones.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The underwire in the cups can pop out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How sleek is this suit from Miraclesuit?

With 34 different patterns — ranging from <strong>pretty florals to tropical prints</strong> — you're bound to find a style that you love. The <strong>ruffled off-the-shoulder silhouette</strong> will look great on all shapes and sizes, and the bathing suit also comes with <strong>removable straps</strong> to make it feel more secure. Just think twice before fully submerging yourself in the pool, though, as this is more a lounging suit, than one made for swimming.

The Madewell Open-Back one-piece washes away our worst fears and grants our biggest wishes by designing a swimsuit design with a plunging neckline that holds larger chests in place with <strong>flexible underwire </strong>and thin, but <strong>sturdy, adjustable straps</strong>. Not to mention, while the <strong>low back</strong> reaches just far down enough to add some interest, we never found ourselves constantly tugging it up for fear of revealing too much. More than that, Madewell included thoughtful details such as<strong> double lining </strong>and <strong>UPF 50 sun protection</strong> for all-around protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Really, we don’t mind that it only comes in one colorway because the ribbed texture adds interest to the overall look.

You can adjust the <strong>high-cut fit</strong> thanks to the drawstrings on the side and the <strong>wire-free scoop </strong>embraces your curves without being uncomfortable. "I was pretty shocked by not only how comfortable the Viottiset swimsuit was when I slipped it on, but how flattering it looked, too," says Butan. "It doesn't feel suffocating or squeeze me in the wrong places, and the cheeky cut is just cheeky enough that it's super cute and won't get scrunched up in your derrière." While she appreciates the <strong>adjustable straps</strong> in the <strong>spaghetti strap design</strong>, you can also buy the one-shoulder version.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 40 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scalloped-cupshe-knotted-scalloped-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Scalloped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cupshe Knotted Scalloped One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e_JdWpIHCuqpE8OaVLxGA4NOenQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cupshe-knotted-scalloped-one-piece-swimsuit-648ab233605d4781ac310043d55d4113.jpg"><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The scallops and cutouts make this suit extra flirty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>You may get some underboob action.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scallops add a little pizazz to the most basic swimsuit, and this design by Cupshe is the perfect balance between simple and flirty. The <strong>knotted top </strong>is extra adorable but also provides the functionality of <strong>adjustable straps</strong>, <strong>removable pads</strong>, and <strong>back hook closure</strong>. Those with bigger breasts may have some underboob, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

You don't have to worry about awkward tan lines or the top slipping down. The ruffles play up your chest while hiding any trouble spots on your arms, and the design features one of the hottest swim trends of the season, cutouts. With all the <strong>vivid colors</strong> and <strong>high-quality materials</strong>, like durable nylon and spandex fabrics, you can easily wear this suit outside of the pool as a top and pair it with<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> snazzy sunglasses</a> to complete the look. Reviewers complain that the white lining pops out sometimes during wear, but it's an easy fix — just fold it back in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–22 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 36 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-long-torsos-ulla-johnson-giordana-maillot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Long Torsos</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ulla Johnson Giordana Maillot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulla Johnson Giordana Maillot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EdIy3IW1tBN80m1AcW1lYuUxnJk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ulla-johnson-giordana-maillot-a96386f12ad44f969889a37bdf65b383.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Those with longer torsos can use the extra-long adjustable straps to get a better fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We’re a little worried about the straps coming untied with this slippery fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Standing out among boring swimwear everywhere, this one-piece design does so much more than add a couple of inches of fabric. It’s made with a lightweight material with a lot of stretch and <strong>long, adjustable straps</strong> you can play with depending on your torso length and how far down you want the deep V-neck to hit. Beyond that, the whimsical mélange of <strong>florals and abstract shapes</strong> printed on the verdant fabric and romantic ruffles make this piece far too stunning to hide under a beach umbrella. As Maguire notes, “I love this bright, mixed print silhouette — and it comes with a matching cover-up that can take you from the pool to happy hour.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>P–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> Veridian | <strong>Padding: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cutout-becca-color-code-santorini-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cutout</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Becca Color Code Santorini One-Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KIOT0-wX7X5SJjZ276xJuV876vw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/becca-color-code-santorini-one-piece-swimsuit-4aaac62c194b44bdb77c35155ee6e4d0.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It combines the look of a bikini with the support of a one-piece.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If you’re looking for modest coverage the high-cut design could be too cheeky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slipping into a bikini is all fun and games until you’re left yanking at slippery strings and tugging on a saggy bottom.

Though its <strong>high-cut leg</strong> could mean you’re showing a bit more skin in the behind area, we’re fans of how this design choice<strong> lengthens the look of our legs</strong>, extending our silhouettes into a true modeled-like form<strong>.</strong> The <strong>three front cutouts</strong> stop just short of the belly button, but this party continues in the back with a <strong>strappy tie-back bow</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–L | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-racerback-body-glove-smoothies-mylene-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Racerback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Body Glove Smoothies Mylene One-piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Body Glove Smoothies Mylene One-piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/taOIql5I1bsuOqjEjz-wjCSdtlU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/body-glove-smoothies-mylene-one-piece-swimsuit-7def41e5c6e740ebb4e3fd8f5a84181a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> We were able to do butterflies, sprints, and flip turns, and the piece kept up with our movements immaculately.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It clings onto the body when wet, revealing everything underneath, including our belly buttons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really put this number's support to the test, by wearing it to a full swim workout routine, and color us impressed with how it held up. Despite the keyhole back, both sides of the body stayed <strong>comfortably covered</strong>, and <strong>never gaped</strong> or required us to adjust it awkwardly, even while doing butterflies, flip turns, and sprints. While it’s not exactly an Olympian’s swimsuit (you know, the ones that go all the way up to your neck and are skin-tight), this did allow us to engage in our full range of motion without ever worrying about exposing ourselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, the suit feels<strong> very lightweight </strong>while still providing coverage, so it was flexible to move around in both wet and dry conditions. When wet, it clings to the skin quite noticeably. We didn’t love how our entire front’s outline was visible (belly button and all) but with the built-in bra, at least our nipples were spared from poking through. It was also<strong> quick to dry</strong> while on, so it never occupied our minds for too long, and it remained opaque through it all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 14 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lap-swimming-tyr-durafast-elite-solid-maxfit-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Lap Swimming</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TYR Solid Maxfit One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TYR Durafast Elite Solid Maxfit One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AzRkuxogz3IyYV81H2v-noDb5a8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/best-one-piece-swimsuits-3b6cf81a12034be58a436282ce65f654.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The<strong> </strong>durable fabric stands up to chlorine and offers sun protection for the regular swimmer.<br><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The suit runs a bit small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking to go all the way with a high-performance suit for laps in the pool, then check out this option from TYR. We especially love that the <strong>fully lined, odor-resistant </strong>one-piece accounts for outdoor swimming, as it boasts <strong>UPF 50+ protection</strong> to keep your skin protected from the sun's harmful rays.

We loved everything about this one piece, from the <strong>adjustable straps</strong>, <strong>ruched front,</strong> <strong>sweetheart neckline</strong>, and most of all, support. Yes, our big chests were not only properly fitted (you chose your size based on your cup size) but also held up comfortably thanks to the cupping and underwire. The additional back clasp, not unlike a bra, provides some <strong>additional support</strong> and lift as well. This option was great for when we wanted support that still felt sexy, as the lower neckline allowed us to get a nice chest tan (post<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> sunscreen</a> application, of course).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The swimsuit never retained a lot of water after we wore it in the pool. In fact, it dried up pretty quickly without ever weighing us down or leaving us feeling sticky. The material was constructed with precision and care, so we feel comfortable spending a little more on a piece that will likely last for many seasons to come. The only thing is that it’s a little long on petite women. If you have a shorter torso, you’ll notice some extra fabric around the tummy bunching up, as it did on our five-foot-two body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-126 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 30D–40K | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-robin-piccone-aubrey-bandeau-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strapless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Robin Piccone Aubrey Bandeau One Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Robin Piccone Aubrey Bandeau One Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Bvbx1EfzeDmKXriA-X58_ie8aSo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/robin-piccone-aubrey-bandeau-one-piece-6b730e102c1e4772b1300de574eb44d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Robin Piccone</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The material is next-level soft, sturdy, and lightweight, making us look and feel amazing in it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There aren’t many color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-129 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have one word to describe this swimsuit: wow.

If you want to look amazing, but still feel comfortable (especially around family members), this swimsuit offers <strong>full coverage around the chest and the bum</strong>. The side ties and ruching keep things lighthearted and flirty, and there’s even an included neck strap in case you find yourself wanting to switch up the style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-130 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But we really can’t rave enough over the material.

Two front straps attach in an <strong>artistic crossover design</strong>, hooking with a<strong> golden clasp</strong> at the top of our left shoulder to complete the intriguing <strong>asymmetrical silhouette</strong>. Though it’s a sophisticated design, we wouldn’t wear this anywhere you don’t show a lot of skin because the <strong>thong-style back coverage</strong> is quite cheeky. However, this is all the more reason to double down on its wearability and pair it with a wrap skirt or high-waisted jeans for an everyday bodysuit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-135 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Padding:</strong> No | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-petites-aerie-keyhole-halter-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Petites</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aerie Keyhole Halter One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aerie Keyhole Halter One Piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KIzmozwZa0cMPq67IVCd8TGwaJw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aerie-keyhole-halter-one-piece-swimsuit-40d10e5473044620b33511e55bcaeb88.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aerie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Available in four funky prints and colors and featuring flirty cutouts, you’ll never feel bored wearing this one-piece.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The fabric doesn’t have a ton of stretch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-138 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether we’re trying to rock <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jumpsuits</a> or one-piece swimsuits, petites are often (and unfairly so) left out of the design conversation. So, you can imagine our excitement when we reluctantly tried another style and, instead of finding an awkward bunching of fabric in the middle like we’re accustomed to, this Aerie fit our shorter frames like a couture gown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-139 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, it’s not the most flexible fabric, but its body-hugging fit only pays our silhouette favors. Plus, the <strong>adjustable front-tie straps </strong>offer the opportunity to switch up the style: We can fasten them up around our neck, a plus for bigger busted girls who need more support, or behind our back. If you’ve got a wild streak to you like we do, you’ll swoon over the <strong>funky paisley print </strong>and <strong>radiant flamingo pink.</strong> However, there are more neutral color options, too, like a solid black shade and a black and white polka dot design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-140 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-one-piece-swimsuit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Look for in a One-Piece Swimsuit</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Material:</strong> Sometimes, your swim plans only consist of lying by the pool or on the beach. In those cases, you can’t go wrong with most swim fabrics. However, if you plan to swim regularly in chlorine or salt water, look for durable fabrics, like nylon and spandex, that have been proofed for chlorine and offer sun protection. These features, along with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>proper care</a>, can help your swimsuit last longer. Today, you can also find swimwear with compression material that provides extra support to areas like your tummy and butt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Padding: </strong>To pad or not to pad? Many swimsuits offer removable cups while others come with no padding whatsoever. Depending on your cup size, you may appreciate the extra shape and support of a built-in bra as well as the nipple coverage. Others may enjoy the more natural look and feel of no padding. “Swim padding is always a personal choice. Some people, myself included, don’t care as much and love a little side or underboob,” says Rosenbaum. “Others want their ladies locked in place. If you’re the latter, I would recommend a suit that at least has optional removable cups.”</li><li><strong>Lining: </strong>Have you ever come out of the water only to find that your suit has become practically see-through, especially in all the wrong places? That’s the pitfall of unlined suits, even if the fabric comes in a dark color. To avoid the mishap, double-check if the suit is double-lined, especially when browsing cheaper styles. Also note that some suits have a light inner lining, even when the outside shade is darker. The lining can pop out as you swim and move around, so if you think this mismatch will bother you, look for suits that are the same color on the inside and outside.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I shop for a one-piece when I’m different sizes on top and bottom?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the downsides of a one-piece is that you can’t choose a different size top and bottom, as you can with a two-piece. Don’t give up though. Rosenbaum offers a few tricks and features for finding the ideal-sized one-piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I always recommend starting from the bottom and working your way up. You can often adjust the top of a one-piece, but the bottoms are usually a bit more rigid, So if you’re a medium on the bottom and a large on top, go for the medium suit, and shop a style that features a top that can be loosened,” says Rosenbaum. “Lean into your coverage preference. If you like less coverage, you won’t mind the added cheekiness and exposure of a smaller suit.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, plus-size fashion influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jamie Hamilton</a> says, “If you are different sizes on top and bottom, I always suggest fitting for the largest body part and having the rest tailored for a perfect fit.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I style a one-piece so it feels modern and trendy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Swimsuits aren’t just for the water. Whether you are going from brunch to the beach or dressing up for a pool party, a one-piece can easily become the foundation of a summer outfit. “Versatility is key,” says Maguire. “If a swimsuit has a matching coverup, we definitely see shoppers gravitate towards those styles too — everyone loves a head-to-toe look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And with all the stylish offerings today, you can wear your favorite one-piece as a body suit for a night out. All you need is the right accessories to complete the look. “I love piling on accessories like beaded necklaces, belly chains, and beach totes to pull together a whole look. A sheer coverup or pareo also elevates any swim costume,” says Rosenbaum. “Denim, whether it be high-waisted jeans or a ’90s style jacket, takes your one-piece to a whole other level for off-the-beach wear. And, if you’re feeling extra bold, you can style your favorite one-piece over a longer-sleeve top for a chic layered look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Hamilton says that styling your suit is all about cut and color. “Buy trending colorways and patterns, consider a high-leg cut, cheeky bottoms, or even a swimsuit with sleeves,” she says, adding, “You can even get a peekaboo cut-out for a fun flair.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it better to size up or down in a one-piece swimsuit?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether to size up or down often depends on a retailer’s specific sizing, but generally, Hamilton says that she always goes up one additional size in one-piece swimsuits. However, more importantly, she looks out for supportive design details to ensure the best fit. “<strong>Adjustable straps</strong> are a must for an optimal fit — it’s so annoying when straps fall,” Hamilton says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle beauty and fashion writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> updated this piece with additional insights from Caroline Maguire, fashion director at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shopbop</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Novel Swim</a> designer Laura Paulino Rosenbaum, and Jamie Hamilton, plus-size influencer and digital creator, and editor-tested product picks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Cieslak</a> is a former commerce editor at InStyle and has worked on many sides of the fashion industry, including as a stylist and fashion buyer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yjsdKtZKimlWK9qrHCnmSsr5miwLa106w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
