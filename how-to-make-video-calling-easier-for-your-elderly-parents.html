Laptops and computers aren’t an option anymore, as someone would need to switch them on every time you call your parents. Also, running a laptop 24x7 wouldn’t be the most lucrative option to go with.</p><p>Similarly, if an issue occurs in these devices, getting help during the pandemic would neither be easy nor safe.&nbsp;Luckily, there&nbsp;is a solution to this problem: smart displays!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smart displays are one of the best technological solutions to&nbsp;connect with your&nbsp;elderly parents. These systems are equipped with the latest technology and are low-maintenance&nbsp;while being&nbsp;easy to use. The best part is that if your parents&nbsp;ever encounter an issue, they can unplug and plug in the smart display to turn it back on again!</p><h2 id=purchase-a-smart-display>1. Purchase a Smart Display</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/smart-display-on-table.jpg><p>There are numerous smart displays available for you to purchase as per your unique requirements.

Use Google Duo for Video Calling</h2><p>After finding the optimum device, you might need to keep a few things in mind before you start setting it up. We recommend creating a new Google account for your parents, which they will only&nbsp;use for the smart devices in their home.</p><p>Doing so will drastically improve connectivity between all such devices and make it much easier to manage them remotely.</p><p>Secondly,&nbsp;get a new phone number for this Google account. This will&nbsp;be handy when you want to <a href=#>connect through Google Duo</a> for video calls with your parents.</p><p>Add this number as the primary number for the dummy Google account, followed by adding your own primary account as a household member.
