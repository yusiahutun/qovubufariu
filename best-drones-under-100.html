You also get FPV real-time transmissions, with footage automatically saved to your microSD card. From there, you can edit and upload to social media from your mobile device.</p><p>Flying the drone is also a lot of fun. Pilots can perform 360-degree flips in four directions, while you can control the drone by moving your smartphone thanks to the drone’s integrated G-Sensor. Furthermore, you can map out customized routes on the app, while it also allows for simple voice and gesture controls. These include verbal commands for launching and landing and hand gestures to activate photo and video functions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regarding safety features, the SANROCK U52 has an alarm system alerting you when the signal is weak or the battery is draining.

All this ensures the drone and any objects it encounters are safe from damage. However, the drone doesn’t include a Return Home feature, so you will have to manually guide it back to position when the battery is on its way out.</p><p>The package includes three batteries, each providing a flight time of five to six minutes for a total of up to 18 minutes.

Its lightweight, thin plastic frame also protects the rotors, making this drone a good choice for indoor flying, too.</p><p>The bulky controller is the command center for all features, as you cannot control this drone from a smartphone app. It enables flips and somersaults with simple actions, while you can also control the lights, photography, and video functions directly from the controller.

If you are willing to settle for a preowned drone, you might get lucky and find one with a 4K resolution at under $100. However, when buying new at this price point, the likelihood is that you will have to settle for 480 or 720p. Yet, there are some available that offer Full HD. One of the best is the SANROCK U52. On top of its 1080p video resolution, it is easy to use and has a decent flight time.</p><p>However, you might be looking for a drone under $100 suitable for children or beginners. Buying a low-cost drone with quality features can certainly alleviate fears of damaging expensive gear while you practice your piloting. Mini drones like the Force1 UFO 3000 or the Potensic A20 are tons of fun and pocket-friendly.</p><p>But, for an affordable all-rounder, you could try the Holy Stone HS110D.
