However, amid the Christmas celebrations, the King has imposed a very strict ban on the attendees: a ban on clicking selfies.</strong></p><p>2023 marks the British royal family’s second Christmas under <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ reign. Not only will the King broadcast a speech across the country, he will also spend some quality time with his family. Charles’ Christmas food menu has also been tweaked slightly after a <a href=#>royal ‘choked’ at the table</a>. Christmas is a time when many senior royals spend quality time with the younger generation; hence the King’s Christmas ban is meant to facilitate everybody’s comfort and enjoyment.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1074466118-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-imposes-ban-on-selfies>King Charles imposes ban on selfies</h2><p>OK has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that the monarch intends to celebrate an old-fashioned Christmas with his family this year. To do so, he has introduced a ban on posting any kind of selfies from the celebration. The King only wants carefully controlled, professionally shot photos and videos to be shared with the world.</p><p>Moreover, a well-placed source has said that only royals who have official social media accounts will be able to post pictures from the Christmas festivities. The photos and videos will be shot by a professional appointed by the palace and will be approved before being shared online.</p><p>Hence there will be no mobile phones, photographs, or selfies at the royal Christmas lunch this year. The selfie ban is specifically aimed at the younger guests attending the royal gathering.</p><p>“There will be a lot of teenagers in attendance this year who are very mobile-friendly. It sounds rather funny, but the truth of the matter is they don’t want a photo of the King trying to squeeze a roast potato into his mouth appearing on social media,” the source said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-136104962-1024x619.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-invited-camilla-s-kids-for-christmas-but-not-harry-and-meghan>King invited Camilla’s kids for Christmas but not Harry and Meghan</h2><p>More news about the royal family’s Christmas reveals that the King has invited <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>‘s children and grandchildren for the celebrations this year.</p><p>Senior royals like <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and more will be present at the celebrations. In addition to them, the Queen Consort’s two children (food critic and MasterChef star Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes) have also been invited.</p><p>Along with Tom and Lola, their kids will arrive at Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
