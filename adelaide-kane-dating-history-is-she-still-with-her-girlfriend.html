Yes, in case you didn’t know the Aussie actress is bisexual.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, who has the star dated in the past? And who is her girlfriend now? Find answers as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Is Adelaide Kane Still With Her Girlfriend, Marthe Woertman?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Adelaide Kane and Marthe Woertman have likely broken up. The lovebirds who were inseparable on social media were last spotted together in Jan 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Looking back, the couple first confirmed their relationship in early 2021 through their respective TikTok accounts — with a video of them cuddling up to each other and lip-synching the song “How You Feel (Freestyle)” by DJ Scheme and Danny Towers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The revelation also came a few months after Adelaide came out as bisexual in a TikTok video, telling her Instagram followers “spoiler alert, I’m not straight.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Adelaide, being with Marthe was “relaxing and comfortable.” They rarely argued about anything since they had great communication. Infact, the last thing “closest to fight” Marthe recalled was when she said the pointy paprika tasted the same as the bell pepper. Obviously, Adelaide argued again, “Bell pepper is bell pepper and pepper is pepper.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But with that being said, Adelaide did dislike Marthe’s messiness.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their favorite thing to do was travel and go to concerts. “I think it would be cool if we could go to an MCR concert together,” Adelaide said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Recalling the first time Adelaide noticed Marthe, it was through social media. They then connected online, got into a relationship, and also featured their relationship on TikToks and IGs. And given they both worked on social media, the duo spent more of their time scrolling through their respective IGs — saving sounds and writing inspos. But, they didn’t let social media affect their relationship at all.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rather, being with Adelaide, Marthe realized how deeply she can love someone. “I sound cheesy but I think I kind of forgot and you just made me feel that again,” Marthe made Adelaide weep a little.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Marthe recalled her first impression of Adelaide, “I saw you and then you went to go to pay for the parking ticket while I was waiting in the car and I was like looking for a hotspot so I could text my best friend she is smaller than I thought.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In case you’re interested, Marthe’s best friend is Julie. She often appeared on Marthe’s TikTok.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But out of all the memories, the duo cherishes their time in Mexico, making a video about snacks. It was also their first video ever. Find their video on youtube titled “Addy Experiments: Trying Dutch Snacks Ft. Marthe Woertman”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On Marthe’s birthday (i.e. on August 15) in 2021, Adelaide took it to her IG to share a series of pictures of them captioned, “Happy Birthday to the only person I know who ALWAYS has great hair. You’re gonna crush this next year.”</span></p><h3><b>Adelaide Kane And Torrence Coombs Relationship</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The only relationship that Adelaide Kane and Torrence Coombs share is that of co-stars.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Adelaide and Torrence played the characters, Mary Stuart and Sebastian, respectively, in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Reign </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2013). Thanks to this, they even won an award for favorite new TV drama at the 40th annual People’s Choice Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for those wondering if they dated off-screen at the time? The answer’s no. Torrence was already in a relationship with Alyssa Campanella then. Later, the actor even married the love of his life at a royal California wedding in November 2020.</span></p><h3><b>Did Adelaide Kane And Toby Regbo Ever Date?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Adelaide Kane and Toby Regbo, her co-star from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Reign </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2013), didn’t date. Though there were rumors about it, Adelaide blasted it saying, “I do get it – when you like the characters together so much on the show it seems like a natural progression that the actors would get together. But we are not the characters – we are very different from our characters in real life.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But with that being said, Adelaide did mention that she adored Toby and thought he is a “very talented actor and handsome man”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Toby once shared that he was very comfortable working with Adelaide. He didn’t have to filter anything he said to her. “Just like having a conversation with a bother or a sister,” he explained.</span></p><h3><b>Adelaide Kane Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Marthe Woertman, Adelaide Kane publicly dated her boyfriend Jacques Colimon. They were in a&nbsp; relationship from 2019 to 2020. Sadly, their relationship ended due to the guilt Adelaide felt for her actions against her ex, Joey Pauline.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Adelaide dumped Joey for Jacques! The guilt ate her up.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The actress was with Joey from May 2017 to June 2019.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, from November 2014 to 2016, Adelaide dated Sean Teale, from April 2011 to 2013, she dated&nbsp; Connor Paolo and in 2011 she dated Ian Bohen.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Old Is Adelaide Kane?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Adelaide was born on August 9, 1990.
