Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don't. So carry on. All love," he concluded, with a shrugging emoji of his own.</p><p>Police in Virginia were called to investigate last week after Allen claimed she was pinned down by three white males in the playground during recess, who called her hair "ugly" and "nappy", before proceeding to cut off her locks with scissors.</p><p>However on Monday her family gave a statement to <a href=#><strong>The Washington Post</strong></a>, in which they apologized for the fabricated story.</p><p>"To those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused," wrote her grandparesnts, who are her legal guardians.

To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1d80d843-8121-5ff6-9323-a8366aecd545 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b42be1fd-8369-5560-b33c-8a516586eb0e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a3/5by4/2019/06/12/a324d29d6960578197e78f2c2ab87e55_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Empire' Creator Lee Daniels No Longer Talks to Jussie Smollett Following Scandal: 'I'm Beyond Embarrassed'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"We understand there will be consequences and we're prepared to take responsibility for them," the statement continued. "We know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time."</p><p>Vice-President Mike Pence's wife Karen is a part-time teacher at the $11,500-per-year school.</p><p>Smollett made headlines in January after reporting to Chicago police that he had been the victim of a racist and homophobic assault, claiming he had a noose put around his neck, had bleach thrown on him and was beaten by two masked and MAGA hat-wearing assailants.</p><p>After a weeks-long investigation, Chicago PD said they believed the actor had orchestrated the attack on himself and accused him of paying his trainers and show extras, brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, to carry out the assault.</p><p>Prosecutors later dropped all 16 charges against Smollett in exchange for him performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond. It was a decision that outraged Chicago's then-mayor and the police chief, who demanded that Smollett pay the city the more than $130,000 it cost to fund the investigation.</p><p>Smollett continues to deny that he staged the crime and duped police.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
