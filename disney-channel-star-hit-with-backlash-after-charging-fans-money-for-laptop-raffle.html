Fans weren’t happy with the star after she asked them to pay $5 to partake in her MacBook raffle.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Skai Jackson</a> rose to fame in 2006 when she was on the kids’ <a href=#>TV</a> show, Sesame Street. She then became a household name when she went on to play the character Zuri Ross&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Disney Channel&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;Jessie&nbsp;from 2011–2015. The star has now amassed a huge social media following, as she boasts almost 9 million followers on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1476972080-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-skai-jackson-faces-criticism-for-5-macbook-raffle>Skai Jackson faces criticism for $5 MacBook raffle</h2><p>Many celebrities and <a href=#>influencers</a> take to their social media accounts to host giveaways for their loyal fans and followers, however, Skai’s was a little different as she was asking fans to send $5 for their chance to win a new MacBook Pro.</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>celebrity</a> fans were not impressed as they took to social media to share their opinions.</p><p>“The Disney money has run out,” penned one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user.</p><p>“She has too much money to have to do $5 to give away something. If you wanna give away something give it away but you don’t raffle it off! Basically whatever you paid for it the $5 raffles covered the cost? No, she’s wrong,” commented another.</p><p>Another wrote: “Giiiiirl I know the girl from Jessie ain’t askin’ us for cash.”</p><p>However, others had a different opinion: “If y’all gonna be upset with Skai Jackson for charging 5$ for a d*** raffle, y’all need to have the same energy for the celebs that charge y’all an arm and a leg for stuff they ordered off of shein!” exclaimed one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Disney alum addresses the controversy</h2><p>Of course, the star saw all the criticism from fans on social media, and addressed it during a <a href=#>TikTok</a> live.</p><p>“It is not that serious for a d*** $5. It is called a raffle. I don’t know if you guys have been to school before but I know that I’ve been to school and we used to have raffles all the time.</p><p>“You put in $5, $2, or whatever and you get a prize. People do raffles all the time,” the 21 year old continued.</p><p>She then went on to explain that yes, the money goes towards the prize, and if there was anything left over she was doing a second giveaway soon, so that’s what it would be going towards.</p><p>Skai then stated: “I do not need money. Personally, I do not need money. And I’m not saying this in a bragging way or anything like that, I’m just letting you guys know I do not personally need money.”</p><p>However, some fans weren’t impressed with what she said as one tweeted: “She should do the raffle for free if she claims she doesn’t need the money.”</p><p>Although others didn’t understand why she was getting so much ‘hate’ as one fan took to the platform to say:</p><p>“You guys have no problem entering 50/50 or raffles at events, but suddenly when an actress hosts one it’s a problem? Pick a struggle omg you all cancel people over ANYTHING these days.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Skai hangs with Nicki Minaj at the Barbie premiere</h2><p>Ahead of the highly anticipated <a href=#>Hollywood</a> Barbie movie a whole lineup of celebrity A-Listers including Dua Lipa and <a href=#>Nicki Minaj recently hit the premiere</a>, as did Skai, amid the drama.</p><p>The Disney alum stunned in a smart neutral two-piece, with statement buttons.</p><p>She was even spotted with Queen Nicki herself, as the two posed and blew kisses for the camera.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2Z9cLDIrKWesV2YtaK6zZ6jZquklr9utMitZLChpJ16o63CpKOaq5hirqfAxKtknKCRp7SqusZmnZqmo2K6sLrEsmSfp6JiuaK806inZqqRm7OtsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
