The hundreds of millions of people speaking the language provide a lucrative market for filmmakers who make their films. Since most of these movies have amassed international traction, they have become favourites even among non-Spanish speakers who rely on subtitles to understand what is said.</p><h2>Best sites to watch movies in Spanish online for free</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb3e7b7cbfa85dd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best Couchtuner alternatives to stream movies in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is never easy navigating through the internet as you filter legitimate sites to watch free movies from Spain from illegal sites that can cause you problems. Many legit sites contain Spanish movies, but the number of illegitimate sites dwarfs the legit ones. Movie fanatics should therefore make it their habit to interrogate whether their favourite sites are legit or not. Some of the sites where you can watch free Spanish movies include:</p><h3>1. InkaPelis</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">InkaPelis</a> is one of the famous free Spanish <a href=#>movie sites</a> where users can access content without registering or subscribing for anything. Among its top features is the provision for users to choose the video quality they want to watch from 480p to 720p. Another cool thing is that you can increase or decrease the playback speed to a comfortable level.</p><p class=align-left>While it is not advisable to download content from websites or sources you do not know whether they are legit or not, this website does offer its users a download option for offline viewing. Its homepage layout is easy to navigate, with the most popular movies displayed there and a search box for other films on the site.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb3e7b7cbfa85dd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best KissAsian alternatives for watching Asian movies in 2021</span></p></a><h3>2. RePelis</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">RePelis </a>has probably the largest selection of free movies in Spanish.

As is the case with most of the sites on this list, if a film is not Spanish dubbed, it has Spanish subtitles. In addition, it has a simple interface with a thumbnail grid displaying movies on the homepage and a menu button that will provide links for various genres and take you back to the homepage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4v55mf81h4j.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YesMovies alternatives to watch movies and TV shows online 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of the downsides of this website is that its loading speed is quite sluggish and may be irritating if you are used to fast speeds. In addition to that, when you click on a link, it constantly keeps opening and redirecting you to other tabs, which is a price you have to pay to watch movies for free.</p><h3>7. Movidy</h3><p class=align-left>There are lots of Spanish movies as well as popular English movies with Spanish subtitles on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Movidy</a>.

You are not required to sign up; hence, you won't be giving too much of your information.</p><p class=align-left>If you desire to watch movies in Spanish online for free, you must accept all the risks and potential consequences. The truth is that nothing is free, so you should find out what is in it for such sites. Some will offer free movies in exchange for advertisement through their sites, while others will use the free movies as a cover for stealing private information from their users. Since your <a href=#>security</a> must come first always, go for the legit sites that won't put you at risk.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/484de572243b45f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best 9anime alternatives for HD anime streaming in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This article is intended for general informational purposes only and does not address individual circumstances.
