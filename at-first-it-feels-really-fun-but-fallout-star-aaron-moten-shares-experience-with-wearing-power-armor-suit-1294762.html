The actor said he was drawn to playing a young man struggling to find his place within the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><p>“He’s ambitious. It reminded me of that Shakespeare description of Cassius and Julius Caesar, where he’s like a hungry dog, he just is always wanting of something,” he elucidated. “He has issues with right and wrong because he’s in a world that’s based off of survival first and it’s a harsh reality,” the actor added.</p><p>Moreover, the actor emphasized that wearing the power armor suit is a much different experience.</p><p>“It’s the heaviest thing you can imagine,” he said. “At first, it feels really fun, but it is extremely taxing through a long shoot day...
