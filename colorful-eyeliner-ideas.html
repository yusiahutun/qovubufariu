Now, with the return of season two, the show has managed to inspire many of us to embrace glitz and glamour again during a time when many of our makeup routines have become obsolete due to years of working from home and mask-wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you're a beginner to makeup or someone who gravitates for neutral tones, then wearing a glitter cut crease or a rhinestone winged eyeliner may feel a little too out of your comfort zone — let alone daunting to recreate. An easy way to get in on bright makeup trends, though, is by wearing colorful eyeliner. Rest assured you don't need to create a crazy, graphic shape to get the full effect, either. Sometimes a subtle pop of color is all you need to take your makeup from simple to sensational.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you need help getting started, we tapped professional makeup artists for their best makeup tips on incorporating colorful eyeliner into your routine without it feeling too overwhelming — as well as looks you can recreate at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-prime-the-eyes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Prime the Eyes</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BriAnne Wills</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before applying any color to your makeup, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ariana Frazier</a>, a professional makeup artist, says priming your eyes is a must. "Priming or putting a base on the eyelid helps those colors to really pop," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sara Wren</a>, the Milk Makeup Director of Artistry, agrees and says it's also helpful to prevent any creasing or smudging that might occur as your wear your liner throughout the day.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-choose-an-eyeliner-color-that-makes-your-eyes-pop></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Choose an Eyeliner Color that Makes Your Eyes Pop</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A pro tip from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jasmine Ferreira</a>, the Lancôme Director of Makeup Artistry Education, is to choose a color that compliments your eyes. It's all about creating contrast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For blue eyes, opt for gold, orange, and plum hues," says Ferreira. "Green eyes should opt for purple, pink, and blues, and hazel eyes should opt for green and golds." Typically all colors compliment brown eyes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stick-to-your-go-to-eyeliner-application></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stick to Your Go-To Eyeliner Application</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BriAnne Wills</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We know it's easy to feel like because you're using a colorful eyeliner, you have to do something different or creative with it. However, Ferreria recommends starting small when adding pops of color and using your eyeliner as your normally would. "Use a colored eyeliner instead of a darker eyeliner to create traditional shapes like a classic cat eye, or apply it on the waterline or tightline."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 6 Life-Changing Tips for Applying Eyeliner on Hooded Lids</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-opt-for-an-eyeliner-pencil-over-liquid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Opt for an Eyeliner Pencil Over Liquid</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For beginners using colored eyeliners, opt for a pencil, like Lancôme's Drama Liqui-Pencil ($22, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>) over a liquid liner because they are generally easier to control," says Ferreira.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wren also recommends sticking to eye products that are buildable in pigmentation, like the Milk Makeup Color Chalks ($18, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>). "Sometimes too bright or too opaque of a product can be intimidating, but using something softer like a bright eyeshadow allows you to customize your look," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-choose-an-eyeliner-with-a-different-finish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Choose an Eyeliner with a Different Finish</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your instincts are to avoid bright, neon hues, opt for an eyeliner with a metallic, shimmer, or sparkly finish, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hector Espinal</a>, Fenty Beauty Global Makeup Artist. "A great way for beginners to incorporate colorful eyeliner into their makeup look is to start with a subtle shade or play with a different finish, like a shimmer, if you're still really easing into those brighter shades," he says. "I love using Fenty Beauty Flypencil Longwear Pencil Eyeliner ($23, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>) for looks like this because there is such a wide range of shades and finishes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He recommends trying a shade like Chromewrecker, a light grey matte, or Bad Bride, a white with silver glitter because they offer a nice pop without being a drastic change from typical darker shades.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-make-the-eyeliner-the-focal-point></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Make the Eyeliner the Focal Point</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BriAnne Wills</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Keep your colored liner the focal point, and the rest of your look simple," says Ferreira.
