The singer’s father <a href=#>died on Dec. 5</a> after a long battle with cancer.</p><p>The <a href=#>Sunshine Coast Daily</a> reports that over 100 people attended a funeral for the 73-year-old Urban at the Gregson and Weight chapel in Caloundra. The country singer was joined by his mother Marienne&nbsp;and&nbsp;older brother Shane, but not his wife Nicole Kidman or their two daughters. At the end he drove off in an olive green Lincoln Continental, which is believed to have belonged to&nbsp;Robert Urban.</p><p>The <a href=#>Australian Daily Telegraph</a> is one of several outlets reporting that Keith Urban and his brother Shane delivered the eulogy. "I am so deeply grateful that Dad is not suffering anymore," the “<a href=#>Break On Me</a>” singer reportedly said. "I loved him so much and did not want him to suffer like he was towards the end.”</p><p>The brothers also talked of their father’s love of cars, motorcycles and family.&nbsp;Marienne also spoke, calling Bob her soul mate, and Shane's kids performed on guitar and piano.</p><p>Urban died after a 10-year battle with cancer. At his new Country Music Hall of Fame exhibit Keith Urban <a href=#>shared the news</a> that his father was in hospice, thinking at the time he may have a few weeks to live. Instead his father died in just four days.</p><p>“So [the exhibit] is bittersweet a little bit because [my dad] is the catalyst for all of this," Urban said, recalling how his father always thought it was important he dress like a performer. "My dad is the catalyst for me living in America.”</p><p>Urban’s father died 14 months after Nicole Kidman's&nbsp;father died. It’s not clear why she was not at the funeral, although several outlets have suggested she was too grief stricken to attend.</p><p><strong>Watch: Keith Urban Shares Advice He Got From Dad</strong></p><p><strong>See Photos From Keith Urban's Country Music Hall of Fame Exhibit</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2ZqbVuwdGbmKdllpbBqbHRZp2uppWnrq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
