Do you remember when Aldean paid tribute to Diffie in a hit song?</p><p>Aldean released "1994" as the third single from his Night Train album in 2013. <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a>, Luke Laird and Barry Dean co-wrote the song, which gives lyrical references to&nbsp;a number of Diffie's hits, including "Third Rock From the Sun," "John Deere Green," "Ships That Don't Come In," "Honky Tonk Attitude," "Pickup Man" and more.</p><p>The chorus is an outright, unabashed tribute to Diffie in which Aldean chants, "Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie!"</p><p>"I mean, what else can you say but what an honor it is to have the larger part of a song reference songs of mine," Diffie told <a href=#>Billboard</a> upon the song's release. "To think all of Jason's fans will be chanting my nameâ€¦ pretty dang cool."</p><p>"Every time I hear the song, it puts a huge grin on my face," Diffie added. "It makes me feel that what I worked so hard at actually mattered to someone."</p><p>Diffie's influence is felt in a number of younger contemporary acts. Country stars <a href=#>turned to social media</a> to pay tribute to his influence after he <a href=#>died</a> on March 29, 2020, at the age of 61 after battling the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). He&nbsp;had first&nbsp;announced he had <a href=#>tested positive</a> for the virus just two days prior.</p><p>Aldean was among the stars who paid tribute to Diffie after his death. He <a href=#>turned to social media</a> to write, "This guy was an amazing singer and an even greater person. Such a sad week for the country music world. Joe was always so much fun to be around and I will never forget our Panama City show with @tylerfarr and @therealtracylawrence...We will miss u my friend. Thanks for teaching us how to 'Diffie'."</p><p>Aldean added the hashtag #1994.</p><p><strong>Listen&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Best '90s Country Songs, Including Joe Diffie:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Top 10 Joe Diffie Songs:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What's Your Favorite '90s Country Song?</strong></p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See 50 Essential '90s Country Songs</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXZ%2B8pnnDop2foZViwbO1wa6rnmVhboZ1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
