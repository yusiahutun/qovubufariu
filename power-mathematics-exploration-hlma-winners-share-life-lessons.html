The session was moderated by Professor Shing Yu Leung, Associate Dean of Science at HKUST and over 100 students signed up. Brian and Dorothy shared what they learned from their HLMA experience, their current work, and how mathematics has helped them in their careers.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>After secondary school, Brian pursued a Ph.D. in Mathematics and is now working in finance in the UK, while Dorothy is currently a Ph.D. student at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. With a strong foundation in mathematics, they have taken very different paths.</span></p><span class="Body__StyledAdvert-sc-1cgoct-7 iifsES"></span><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>HLMA encourages participants to develop their own mathematical questions and conduct research independently or as part of a team, an approach different from traditional schools where students are being presented with mathematical problems and answers. The experience made Brian realise that there may be more than one answer to a mathematical problem and that exploring a topic may lead to more questions. The winners encouraged students to enjoy the learning opportunities, even if not all the questions are answered.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The research experience also helped Brian and Dorothy develop lifelong skills which are essential to their careers. Brian’s work in finance is result-oriented with shorter timelines, whereas in academic research, studies may take several weeks, months or even years, but the same problem-solving and critical thinking skills are required.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=8f291ce8-f4b6-427e-a9d7-98009f942ed0 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Journey to infinite possibilities through mathematics exploration</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>“Studying maths provides you with the skills to find solutions.
