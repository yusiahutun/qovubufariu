And with the movie in limbo, fans wondered if they would ever see the conclusion of the <i>Guardians</i> storyline. However, Gunn and Disney were able to <a href=#><span class=s2>negotiate his return</span></a> to both the company and the franchise in 2019. The movie was filmed from November 2021 to May 2022, and premiered in theaters May 5, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Here’s everything we know so far about James Gunn’s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>; and whether there might be a script for <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Guardians of the Galaxy 4</i></a> in the works.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-3-3.jpg><h2 class=p3><span class=s1>Will there be a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 4?</span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 the last film in the series?
