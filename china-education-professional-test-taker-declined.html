At the time he was attending Beida Affiliated Experimental School in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, later renamed the Boya School in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He then transferred to Qingniao Experimental School in Huazhou in southwestern Guangdong province at the beginning of this year and sat the gaokao for a third time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this month, the Huazhou school released a congratulatory poster praising Quan for getting the highest marks out of all 70,000 students in Maoming city which administers Huazhou.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/30/4350ff4c-75e6-406f-b05d-3d1ba5711c63_83b03ffa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not clear whether Quan has been again admitted by PKU this year. But with such a high score, he would easily gain admission to any elite university he chose.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both secondary schools award students who make it to either PKU or Tsinghua University one million yuan (US$150,000), according to enrolment advertisements.</p>There is no policy regulating how many times a person can take the gaokao. Chinese media has often reported on people who <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">re-take the gaokao numerous times</span></a> after they failed to achieve high enough scores to get admission to their preferred universities.An official at the student enrolment department of PKU said it was up to Quan to take up or decline an admission offer, Shandong news site <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">w.dzwww.com</span></a> reported.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Some don’t like it hot: outcry over woman dirty dancing in front of boy on train</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tianmu News said the Huazhou Education Bureau is investigating Quan’s case and will release the investigation result later. Local media reported that Quan told his classmates at the Zhanjiang school that he gave up his spot at PKU the first time because the major he was allocated was not what he wanted to study.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many private secondary schools in mainland China offer cash incentives to lure high-scoring students to enrol and re-take the gaokao. School-switching students achieving high gaokao marks can lift the school’s reputation and help it attract more enrolments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, said while most students resit the gaokao hoping to get into a better university or a better major, there are some deemed as “professional test takers”, who re-take the test for the lucrative incentives offered by private institutions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These students regard retaking the gaokao as a way to make money,” Xiong told the South China Morning Post. “For both the students and the institutions, it’s short-sighted and mercenary.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This student has taken up a place at Peking University. He has no credit. What he did is not fair to other students,” said one person on Weibo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another user said: “He makes money with his academic abilities. I just want to say that even graduates from PKU can not make that much money in two years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5Jqb2xuaWV8pLTIp5hmnZSqsKLAyKilZqiipLOmv9KipqeZnGLBpr%2FTZquao5WneqWxwqWgp52U</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
