The “Jolene” singer revealed that her longtime husband, <a href=#><strong>Carl Thomas Dean</strong></a>, is “a real rock ’n’ roll freak.”</p><p>On the album, due out on November 17, Dolly, 77, covered a number of rock classics in addition to joining forces with several other music icons for a medley of songs. <a href=#><strong>Ringo Starr</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a>, <strong>Linda Perry</strong>, <strong>Ann Wilson</strong> and<strong> Nikki Six</strong> are among the stars who helped bring Dolly’s vision to life.</p><p>“I didn’t want to maim them up, and I tried really hard to sing them well and stay as true as I could to the form, but with my voice,” she told The Guardian about performing songs in her husband’s favorite genre.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time the songstress dished on how <a href=#>her very private spouse</a> inspired her newest music venture.</p><p>“I’m going to do a lot of his favorite songs,” she told E! News of the project ahead of her Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in November 2022. “He loves <a href=#><strong>Mick Jagger</strong></a>, he loves ‘Satisfaction’ — those kind of songs. I’m hoping to have <a href=#><strong>Elton John</strong></a>. I’m hoping to have just a lot of the big classic artists singing some of the classic songs.”</p><p>Nobody has been prouder of Dolly’s recent accomplishments than Carl, 81, who has remained largely out of the spotlight for most of their relationship.</p><p>“When I got nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, I thought, ‘Well, no better time to do it,’” Dolly said of doing a rock album for the first time in an interview with Pollstar in October 2022. “I had always wanted to do it. My husband is a big hard rock ’n’ roll fan, and for years I thought, ‘One of these days I’d like to do an album mainly just for him, just to kind of do it.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dolly-Partons-New-Album-Was-Inspired-by-Husband-Carl-Thomas-Dean-1.jpg><p>While Dolly and Carl have rarely been seen together since getting married in 1966, their love for one another has never wavered.</p><p>“She adores and is committed to Carl. They’re a team and Dolly will always be there for him,” an insider exclusively told Closer of their rock-solid marriage in July 2021. “Dolly is steadfast in her devotion and love for him. Dolly, like Carl, has always said that they’re in it for the long haul.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqWkqWK9or7TqKWsZZ6axG6ty5uspmWnlsButc2sp6KqlZl6o8WMoaysmpGjsW6vwKujZqyYpLqiv4ydnJqmXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
