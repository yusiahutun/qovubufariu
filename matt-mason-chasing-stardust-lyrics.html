The song is a personal tune which Mason wrote with Kat Gravitt and Gerald O'Brien about his struggles in the past with drugs.</p><p>"We wrote the song probably a year and a half ago," Mason tells Taste of Country. "Gerald’s got a studio over in Green Hills [in Nashville], and I’ve known Kat for a long time. We sat down and wanted to find the direction where I was wanting to go musically and what style I was wanting to do ... what I’m wanting to say to people, and what kind of songs do I want to sing about. We wrote this initially for being an album cut, not thinking that we ever would be making it into a music video like what’s been done. We wanted to write a song about me that fits me, my story wrapped into a song. She knows my past with drugs and all that. I said, well, let’s maybe start with that direction."</p><p>"The song is about an addict’s mind and the way you think, and everything’s face paced," Mason continues of the lyrics. "You’re kind of on the edge of insanity. It’s kind of the downside of drugs when you’re looking for it and trying to find it."</p><p>"Running like hell from a cheap motel / I don't care where and I don't know much / But I do know why / Gotta feel that high / Gotta feel that high," he sings in the opening verse.</p><p>"We messed around with some ideas, and we got on the Internet and looked up drug slang for cocaine," says Mason. "We wanted to find something that means that drug, but I didn't want everybody to say, 'Oh, he's just the guy who sings about drugs all the time.' That's my story, but that's just part of my story. It's not the whole thing. We found out that 'stardust' is another name for cocaine. I thought that would be a cool title: ‘Chasing Stardust.’"</p><p>"Always on my mind / See it in my eyes / Won't let me sleep / When I lay down at night / I'm addicted to / The thought of you / Can't say goodbye / That's what it's like chasing stardust," Mason sings in the song's chorus.</p><p>"When I heard ‘Chasing Stardust,’ I said, ‘That’s not going to be a radio song,’ but everybody loves it, so maybe it can make it to radio and do something that’s different than what everything else is about, which would be great for me," notes Mason. "That can set me apart a little bit. That’s still a possibility of that being a single. It’s not out of the question. Hopefully we can at least get it on the first record. It could potentially be a great first single to set the tone for kind of what I’m wanting to do."</p><p><strong>Watch the Matt Mason 'Chasing Stardust' Video<br></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmppmkqXqurdKopWabmJbAqrrGZqqtmaKZwrTAjKWwq6GTqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
