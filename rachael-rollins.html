She received her fair share of resistance at this point, with US senator Tom Cotton saying he will try to prevent Rachael from being confirmed at the office. Senator Ted Cruz claimed that Rollins will not prosecute certain crimes as she stated. Due to such strong opposition from senator Cotton and senator Cruz, a committee vote to advance Rachael’s nomination was delayed in September 2021. As Cotton needed time to convince his colleagues to oppose Rachael’s election. On September 30th, 2021 the committee ended up having a tie of 11-11 votes. On December 8th, Vice President Kamala Harris, cast a vote on the senator’s motion invoking cloture, which broke the tie and confirmed Rollin’s nomination.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Rachael Rollins Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Rachael Splaine Rollins</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>3 March 1971</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>50 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Lawyer, Politician</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Pisces</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rachael-Rollins-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 6” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 168 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 76 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 167 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>7.5 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>John Rollins</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Esther Rollins</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Buckingham Browne & Nichols School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>University of Massachusetts Amherst, Georgetown University Law Center</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rachael-Rollins-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Husband</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u1f3fdb70853b3542c2844514d6cdba1f><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Hugh O'Leary Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Rachael Rollins married a decade ago although her husband and she have been separated.
