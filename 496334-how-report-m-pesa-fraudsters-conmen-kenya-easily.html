Here are several things you can do to protect your M-PESA account.</p><ul><li>Prevent SIM Swap by dialling *100*100#.</li><li>If someone tries registering a new line using your national ID number, Safaricom will send you an SMS to confirm whether you are registering a new line. You will receive an SMS from number 707, and it is best to verify the message.</li><li>Recognise the official Safaricom contacts. Safaricom will only call you from the number 0722000000.</li><li>Even if Safaricom or M-PESA staff calls you, do not give them your M-PESA PIN, SIM passcodes, or passwords. Safaricom staff will never ask you to share personal information.</li><li>Avoid sending money to unknown callers.</li><li>Avoid sharing personal details with anyone on Safaricom branded links, websites, or social media platforms.</li><li>Avoid pressing any codes on your phone as directed by anyone purporting to be from Safaricom. The codes could block your line or send money to a conman.</li><li>Always protect your personal information, such as your national ID number, date of birth, and address, because fraudsters can use them to steal from your M-PESA account.</li><li>Avoid callers requesting you to offer refunds to<a href=#> M-PESA transactions.</a> Instead, advise them to use 456 or call Safaricom support services to reverse their money.</li><li>Register your voice as your password.</li><li>Be wary of promotional or hoax messages from unknown senders.</li><li>You can avoid fraudulent activities by ensuring your SIM card has an active SIM lock. In other words, use strong passwords and keep personal information off social media.</li><li>Avoid callers who claim your number is double registered. Double registration of phone numbers is impossible.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e1c407ea3b90598d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inside William Ruto Cabinetâ€™s Flashy Lifestyles: Top Officials Publicly Splurge Cash as Kenyans Struggle</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you have already shared your personal information with unknown callers, change your PIN immediately.
