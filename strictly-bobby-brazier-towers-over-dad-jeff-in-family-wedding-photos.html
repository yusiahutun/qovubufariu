Jeff shares his two sons Bobby and Freddie with his ex-wife Jade Goody, and they were aged just five and four when their mother died from cervical cancer in 2009. The Finders Keepers star went on to find love with Kate in 2013, and the pair <a class=hm-link href=#>tied the knot five years later</a> at Tivoli Carvoeiro resort on the Algarve.</p><p id=e7T9V8h7kSM data-wc=28>Bobby and Freddie acted as best men for their dad, with EastEnders actor Bobby showing off his impressive height in beautiful family wedding photos shared exclusively with HELLO!.</p><p id=e2ivuwBw5SJ data-wc=29>The trio wore matching white jackets, bow ties, cropped trousers and loafers, while the bride looked beautiful in a strapless Merci wedding dress by Madeline Gardner from Bellissima Weddings.</p><p id=eHsprCUu56B data-wc=32>After they exchanged vows, the newlyweds posed for photos in the sunshine.
