With Mother’s Day fast approaching, this is the perfect excuse to treat not only yourself but also your significant other. It also works as the perfect gift for your wife, girlfriend, husband, or boyfriend. If you love working out together, try a fitness box. If you are foodies and savor gourmet grub and fine wine, then subscribe to one that can offer you a taste of something neither of you have ever experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>When selecting a subscription box, remember the prices are based on the type and size of products. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beauty boxes</a> can cost about $10 per month, but oftentimes the products are sample sizes. This is great because it gives you a chance to try something without spending a lot of money. Before committing to a box, it is a good idea to research the price ranges for full-size products. It will help you determine whether to go with a less expensive box and buy full-size products later or to go with a box that costs more but offers full-size products or includes more items.</p><p>Another factor to consider is whether the box will save you money. If you and your partner enjoy drinking coffee every weekend at a local cafe, calculate how much you spend there. Then, consider the price of a monthly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coffee subscription box</a> and compare the costs. You may realize that sitting at home unpacking your box of brews might be more cost-effective and enjoyable.</p><p>As monthly subscription boxes gain in popularity, it gets harder to narrow down the choices. So we picked some that are sure to surprise and inspire you and your mate. Need more inspiration? We’ve also found the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">best subscription boxes for moms</a> and <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">best subscriptions for dads</a>.</p><p><strong>Check out our picks for 10 of the best monthly subscription boxes for couples below.</strong></p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
