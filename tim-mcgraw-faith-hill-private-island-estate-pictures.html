They told the magazine that the building project turned out to be quite a bit more extensive of an undertaking than they had initially anticipated.&nbsp;They ended up having to build housing for the construction staff, and then they had to create infrastructure for construction crews, including electricity and water.</p><p>“We set out to build a house,” Hill said. “We had no idea we had to build everything else. We basically had to build a little town.”</p><p>The couple and their three daughters used to vacation on the island and stay in yurts while their spectacular main residence was under construction, and the listing from <a href=#>Knight Frank</a> includes the two beachfront yurts,&nbsp; three staff houses, engineering facilities and mechanical storage, as well as a private dock.</p><p>The main house is situated on a high point near the center of the island to provide the most sweeping views of its pristine beauty. The awe-inspiring mansion consists of&nbsp;6,517 square feet, with nearly 5,000 additional square feet of covered verandas and open hallways that connect the eight individual "pods" of the main house.</p><p>Those pods center around an internal courtyard, and the property also features a soaring great room, while the living room opens directly onto a pool terrace The master bedroom is a suite with its own massive closet and bathroom, and there are three other bedrooms, one of which is designed as a kids' dorm with bunkbeds and two bathrooms. There are a total of five bathrooms in the residence, which is built to take the most advantage of the indoor-outdoor lifestyle the area affords.</p><p>L’île d’Anges, which is also referred to as Goat Cay, comprises 19.77 acres and offers nearly 1.3 miles of waterfront property.</p><p>It's unclear from the listing if McGraw and Hill still own the property currently, or if the island is being listed on behalf of another party.</p><p>The superstar country couple are no strangers to luxury living.&nbsp;They have also owned an 11,000-square-foot, 6-bedroom, 9-bathroom&nbsp;<a href=#>mansion in Beverly Hills</a>, which they sold for $9.5 million in 2009., as well as a <a href=#>lavish Nashville mansion</a> that they sold in 2009. They continue to own a&nbsp;<a href=#>historic rural estate</a>&nbsp;on a large piece of land in Leiper's Fork, Tenn., in addition to their primary residence, which public records show is a 5-bedroom, 10-bathroom, 22,460-square-foot home.</p><p>Scroll through the pictures below to see inside Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's island paradise, and keep scrolling to inside their other spectacular homes.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See More Country Singers' Homes</a><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Tim McGraw + Faith Hill's Private Island Estate:</h2></p><p><strong>See Inside Tim McGraw + Faith Hill's Stunning Nashville Estate:</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's Spectacular Beverly Hills Mansion:</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's Historic Tennessee Manor Home:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraGdYrqks9GarmaekZ7BqXnHoqOlZaCntret055koquclrulecSsq5qslWK9qq%2FTrqmeq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
