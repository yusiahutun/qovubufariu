Now, think of a combination of both. These influencers whose niche is food are what we call foodie influencers and today, we’re gonna talk about how to become one. So, fasten your seat belts, we are going on a delicious journey!</p><p>Before we dive into details of being a foodie influencer, you should know that it’s not an easy task and it requires a lot of patience and effort. But if you’re passionate about food and set your mind on becoming a foodie influencer, there’s nothing to stop you. All you need to do is to learn the steps to make your work easier and don’t worry, this article will help you through your journey.</p><h2>Find Your Niche</h2><p>First of all, food is a huge area to focus. So, saying my niche is food if you’re to become a foodie influencer does not sit right. Instead, your focus must be more specific than food. For example you can always focus on some diets. If your niche is vegan diets, your posts should be in line with this niche. It would be better for you to decide on your posts from this point of view. With this way, it will be easier to attract users whose focus is vegan diets to your page. And, those followers will always be loyal to you if you don’t go out of your route. Can’t even think the high engagement rate you’ll receive from your loyal followers if you stay loyal to your and their niche too! Here are some suggestions for you:</p><ul><li>10-minute recipes</li><li>Sugar free diets</li><li>Gluten-free diets</li><li>Cocktail recipes</li><li>Colorful recipes</li><li>Sweets only</li><li>Salties only</li></ul><h2>Join The Community</h2><p>As I’ve said before, it’s all about passion! There are other fish in the sea just as passionate about food as you are. You need to find them, and you need to show yourself. In the end, social media requires interaction and as a foodie influencer, your interaction with other foodie influencers must be strong. Besides, there’s nothing greater than meeting new people who shares the same interests with you. You can always learn from each other, and even start a project together. So, my advice to you: explore, share, interact as we say here at INFLOW!</p><h2>Don’t Feel Obliged to Say Yes</h2><p>Sometimes, as an influencer, you may feel obliged to say yes to everything in order not to offend anyone or to gain some extra money. But, you should avoid this situation as much as you can. Never forget that this is actually your business, and you work really hard for this. So, you don’t have to share anything you don’t want to share or recommend. Of course, there will be brands that you like and want to work, and mutual agreements can be made with these brands. But you should always remember that you don’t have to work with every brand. You should feel free to say no. Brands that are not suitable for your niche only decrease your followers’ attention. So, find the brands that suits what you’re doing and give honest recommendations only! This will also help creating a more trustable bond between you and your followers.</p><h2>It’s All About Aesthetics</h2><p>Aesthetics is everything. Remember that you’re actually on social media and your followers can’t taste or try to do what you shared instantly. First, you have to get their attention, and then it’s time for them to decide. There is a very easy way to get attention on social media: right angle, right light, right background. A right photo shoot can make a very simple sunny side up look like a masterpiece, and a great meal with the wrong shot can look awful. So, it’s all in your hands. If you want to get your followers’ attention, first you should give them what they want from social media. And it is aesthetics.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sunnysideup.jpeg alt width=580 height=580 sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>It’s time to take that step!
