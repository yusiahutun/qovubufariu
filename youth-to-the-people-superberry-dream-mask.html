It was like a parabolic curve from high school pre-calc: What started as a trickle of goopy green formulas quickly escalated into a flood of masks claiming to do it all. For most, the results were short-term at best. Yet where they crawled, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Youth to the People's Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Mask</a> runs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In retrospect, it makes sense that the masks of yesteryear didn't do much. There were a few exceptions — formulas that specialize in exfoliating or pore-clearing come to mind — but peel-off masks in particular were a disappointment. Most masks are designed to only sit on your face for ten or so minutes, so it's no wonder that they often wouldn't have the effect they'd claim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So I started reading through the Dream Mask's reviews as a cynic. But the product's 400+ five-star ratings are so persuasive, it might just be the mask to make me believe again, not least because it's intended to be left on all night. Earn that bathroom real estate, etc.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $48; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">youthtothepeople.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Not only is the texture and color of this mask very pleasing, but it works incredibly well," writes one shopper of the whipped, buttery-yellow Dream. "When I wake up in the morning, I can't help but stare at my glowing and hydrated skin." Another person writes they see a "visible improvement in wrinkles immediately," and one more says it's given them the skin they had 20 years ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At 43, my skin has become dry and dull over the years," continues the latter shopper. "When I use this face cream at night, I awake to the dreamiest and most heavenly glow. The first couple nights of trying it, I saw myself in the mirror the next morning and audibly gasped. My face feels supple, plump and dewy. I've been using this for nine months and I refuse to go a single night without it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the "mask" designation, myriad reviewers discuss <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">using the Dream Mask</a> as a night cream, milking the full benefits from its combination of squalane and vitamin C (think of it like an amped-up, night version of a vitamin C serum). Those two join with hydrating prickly pear extract and maqui fruit extract, which the brand says is the "most antioxidant dense fruit in the world;" acai fruit extract, goji extract, and moringa leaf extract also come in, as do protective panthenol and vitamin E.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tons of people also mention using the mask to combat retinol's dryness, soothing irritation to leave skin feeling glowy, soft, and luxurious. Those with oily skin see just as great benefits as people on the dry side, one person with an abundance of oil and large pores writing that the lightweight texture leaves their skin feeling like silk. Its effect on fine lines, stretch marks, and dark spots also warrants enthusiastic reviews, like two titled "Holy fountain of youth!" and "MAGGGGIIIC IN A JAR."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Truly, my favorite overnight mask I've ever owned. It's yellow, berry-smelling sorcery," the second fan wrote. "It's the only mask I've ever used that, when I wake up the next day, I see a PHYSICAL difference in my skin. My dark spots and acne scars are lighter, my super dry skin is replenished, my skin is GLOWING."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another shopper writes that the mask is so potent, their skin glows and looks "much younger," redness and uneven tone calmed so much that they're now going makeup-free after trying a free sample. As a last person says, "I put it on before bed and my skin is soft, fine lines less. A little goes a long way, [it] lasts for months. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Excellent product</a>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1osKitpJ16tbuMrZ%2BeZaCavLG4xGaqrqiVp6%2BmvtGyZJ2qlZa6brnArKI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
