I might even have hundreds, to be honest. I can’t be sure but I know I have way too many - I could probably open my own jean shop; from long to short, boyfriend to girlfriend, skinny to straight and even ripped - I’ve got them all. I love my <a class=hm-link href=#>Topshop</a> jeans and my <strong>Levi’s</strong>, but could I be convinced by a Spanx pair? Hmmm. I wasn’t so sure. As much as I want my denim to hold me in at times I’m not sure I want to wrestle to get a pair on - à la Bridget Jones and her pants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4ed8f80488e2-me-in-topshop-jeans-z.jpg><p id=eQo_vnEbwWsaB data-wc=23><strong>This is me in my <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Topshop Orson jeans</a> which I love, but they definitely don't pull me in - hence why I always wear a blazer</strong></p><p id=eDDoj9dRatzPJ data-wc=89>When I got invited to try on the new season denim pieces at Spanx’s headquarters in London, I went along secretly thinking I’d find a pair of black denim jeans I’d wear in winter after I’d consumed far too many Quality Street, mince pies, and boozy <a class=hm-link href=#>Christmas</a> lunches - the jeans you’d pull on but wouldn’t wear them for your fanciest occasion. But I was wrong - these are amazing. They might even be a ‘save for best’ jean, and we all know that’s the highest honour to dish out.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0abe7df2a40-blue-spanx-jeans-z.jpg><p id=eu3UI8Zfnc1pT data-wc=5><strong>SHOP:</strong> <strong>Spanx&nbsp;denim jeans, £112,</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow> ASOS</a></p><h6><span><a aria-label=asos class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=er4TlIvqQ5FYx data-wc=61>Out of blue, soft black, grey and white, I was shocked to discover that the white jeans might be the most flattering white jeans I’ve ever tried on. Ever. I’m a size medium (or a UK 12) but with&nbsp;a tum. Classic apple shape and some jeans can emphasise it. But with Spanx, the tum vanished. Gone. It’s an absolute miracle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2867296049d1-spanx-jeans-me-white-z.jpg><p id=ewz3e3t_VFiiY data-wc=6><strong>SHOP: Spanx whiet denim jeans, £89, <span><a aria-label="white jeans" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Selfridges</a></span></strong></p><p id=eHzLBa2pOwpdx><span><a aria-label="white jeans" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></p><p id=eoR4Iw2x7hd6q data-wc=50>They also weren’t too hard to put on, and once on, they felt more comfortable than I thought. Will I need someone to pull them from the ankles after too many wines? Potentially. I’m looking forward to waking up still wearing them on the morning after the <strong>HELLO! </strong>Christmas party.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ffef36b74f8b-black-spanx-jeans-z.jpg><p id=eBhDzoP5jhe1q data-wc=5><strong>SHOP: Black Spanx jeans, £112, <span><a aria-label="spanx black jeans" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Selfridges</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr><span><a aria-label="black spanx jeans" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=e9mvx_2E4IH7N data-wc=50>More denim is coming soon, and I hear belt hooks are on the horizon (yes!) and a crop flare (double yes!). I’m loyal to skinny jeans, but I’m well aware that the current trends are more cropped, flared and Simon Cowell-esque. The latter scares me just as much as you.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3AZkSrFJZAqK data-wc=47>At £112, these jeans aren’t cheap but Spanx founder <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sara Blakely</a> didn’t become a millionaire for creating a bargain product, did she? If you don’t know the story of how Spanx was created, you need to swot up on Sara - she is one of my favourite female #girlbosses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/921bc34c31bb-sara-z.jpg><p id=eAQO4lKrzlLC6 data-wc=80>At 27-years-old she was selling fax machines door to door and was desperate to reinvent her life. After not being able to wear a pair of cream trousers hanging in her wardrobe because she didn’t have the correct underwear for them, she decided to create them herself - and that’s how she came up with Spanx - hosiery that eliminates VPL. Her genius idea took over the world and is one of the most recognisable brand names to this day.&nbsp;</p><p id=eR2HtFXKXA2MA data-wc=10>These jeans won’t be for everyone, but well, I’m sold.</p><p id=etdZjxz2Ud8-b data-wc=23>This article contains affiliate links, which means HELLO! may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase. <a class=hm-link href=#>More information</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWimlazAcH6PanBpcWFlhHiBj29mrKiRo8VutsSapaxloprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
