Replying to this, they replied, “There is nothing like that.

Abhimanyu and Akshara were separated after being married for a long time. The show took a leap and showed the couple living separately. Fans could not stand the show’s leads and their favorite couple going separate ways. They even started the hashtag on Twitter, #Bring AbhiRa back. Since fans are eagerly waiting for them to reunite, it seems there might be some good news for them. Harshad Chopda shared in a recent interview, “I am 100 percent confident that the problems between Abhira will get over soon and situations will get better between them. The track we are currently shooting is very interesting and the upcoming episode is going to witness a lot of twists and turns.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai: Harshad Chopda breaks silence on dating Pranali Rathod",1220130,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/shweta-tiwari-to-charu-asopa-5-tv-actresses-who-suffered-two-failed-marriages-1220100","articlepage","/tv/news/yeh-rishta-kya-kehlata-hai-harshad-chopda-breaks-silence-on-dating-pranali-rathod-1220130","Content Also read","tv","news"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai: Harshad Chopda breaks silence on dating Pranali Rathod",1220130,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/shweta-tiwari-to-charu-asopa-5-tv-actresses-who-suffered-two-failed-marriages-1220100","articlepage","/tv/news/yeh-rishta-kya-kehlata-hai-harshad-chopda-breaks-silence-on-dating-pranali-rathod-1220130","Shweta Tiwari to Charu Asopa; 5 TV actresses who suffered two failed marriages","Also_Read","tv","news")'><strong>Shweta Tiwari to Charu Asopa; 5 TV actresses who suffered two failed marriages</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGirr2eemsS0e9ien2aqmai1ta2MpLCaZZuata2t05pkoZmZYrWivtKhmJ1lk528sbDAZpmrnZGgwG6%2FyKWcp5uVYryvecOaq6Kml2K9s63NmqOiZaKWwam7w2Zoa2pgZoBx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
