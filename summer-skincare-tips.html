But by following the right skincare routine, you can address these common summer skin concerns — and even help to prevent them in the first place. To learn more, we turned to top dermatologists to find out how to keep your skin looking its best throughout the summer season — and beyond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for eight expert-approved summer skincare tips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-level-up-your-sunscreen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. Level-Up Your Sunscreen</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dermatologists agree that proper UV protection is by far the most important step in any skincare routine year-round, but especially during the summer when the days are longer and you inevitably spend more time in the sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"SPF should be applied every day to areas that are exposed — which often includes the face, neck, chest, ears, and hands — and it is especially important to reapply every two hours, or sooner if swimming or sweating, as people spend more time outdoors in the summer months," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Marisa Garshick</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What's more, make sure your sunscreen is SPF 30 or higher, stresses Dr. Melanie Palm, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Art of Skin MD</a>. And if you need to reapply on the go, Dr. Garshick recommends a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>powder sunscreen</a> like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Brush-On Shield SPF 50</a>, or an SPF compact like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Avène's Mineral Tinted Compact SPF 50</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-apply-the-right-amount-of-spf></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Apply the Right Amount of SPF</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also key to apply enough sunscreen to ensure you get adequate protection. "You should follow the two-finger method when applying sunscreen to your face and neck," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Karan Lal</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New Jersey. "Apply one strip of sunscreen on each of your index and middle fingers, which is the appropriate amount for the face every day. When it comes to the body, a shot glass amount is appropriate for exposed areas."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-consider-extra-protection-from-the-sun></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Consider Extra Protection From the Sun</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reduce your exposure to UV rays by carefully choosing the time of day you spend outdoors. "Seek shade and try to avoid being in direct sunlight from 10 am to 4 pm for outside activities when UV rays are most extreme," suggests Dr. Palm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can also wear UPF clothing of 50 or more in addition to your sunscreen or take a supplement that enhances UV light protection. Dr. Palm calls out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Heliocare</a>, which contains the plant polypodium leucotomos.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-lighten-up-your-moisturizer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Lighten Up Your Moisturizer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though you're sweatier in the summer, your skin still needs to be moisturized. However, since seasonal dryness isn't common in the summertime, you don't need as rich a cream as you use in the winter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm all about putting away the petrolatum and thick moisturizers and switching to light hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers," says Dr. Lal. "These moisturizers are great at maintaining hydration without making you feel sticky and heavy." We're fans of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Laneige's Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer</a>, which includes various sizes of HA for better absorption.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-refresh-skin-with-a-mist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Refresh Skin With a Mist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Lal also recommends a face mist to refresh skin throughout the day, as needed. "My favorite one right now is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>La Roche-Posay Serozinc Face Mist</a>, which reduces shine and minimizes pore size," the dermatologist says. "I use this before events so I don't come across greasy at the end of a long day."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-make-sure-your-products-are-non-comedogenic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Make Sure Your Products Are Non-Comedogenic</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clogged pores can lead to breakouts in the summer. An easy way to prevent sweat and oil from building up in your pores is to use non-comedogenic skincare and makeup products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I recommend looking for non-comedogenic products, meaning products that do not cause or contribute to breakouts," Dr. Palm says. "Avoid deeply moisturizing or oily formulations during the summer months."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To help keep pores clear, those with acne-prone and oily skin can incorporate ingredients such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>salicylic acid</a>, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, or niacinamide into their routines. "All of these ingredients help with acne and are anti-inflammatory," Dr. Palm explains. "Just check with your M.D. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as some of these are not appropriate for use."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-wash-your-face-properly></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Wash Your Face Properly</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Since you're sweating more during the summer months due to outdoor activities or simply being more active, I also recommend washing your face up into your hairline as well — this area is usually overlooked, which can result in breakouts along the hairline or the outer edges of your face," says Dr. Palm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is when it's time to bring out the big guns such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid-containing washes," Dr. Lal adds. "These washes will unclog your pores and also kill off acne-producing bacteria."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is where a foaming or gel cleanser can come in. Dr. Garshick recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SkinCeuticals Purifying Cleanser</a>, which contains glycolic acid. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>CeraVe's Renewing SA Cleanser</a> is an affordable face wash with salicylic acid.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-use-a-retinoid-in-moderation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Use a Retinoid in Moderation</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there are no ingredients you should stop using in the summer, you may find you have to adapt how you use them. Retinoids are one such ingredient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Summer is when people start noticing more irritation from their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol/retinoid</a>. Retinols and retinoids make you more sensitive to the sun," Dr. Lal explains. "It is for this reason, I recommend either reducing the frequency of use or being more aggressive about sunscreen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, with extra sun protection, you can continue to use your retinoid or retinol. In fact, Dr. Garshick recommends a retinoid lotion such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Differin</a> "to regulate skin cell turnover and prevent the pores from becoming clogged."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1oqq6lnZq%2Fbr%2FKoqWcmaKaerW1z6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
