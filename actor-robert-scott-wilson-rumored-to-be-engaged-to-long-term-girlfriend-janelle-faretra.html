Of course, fans were heartbroken to learn the news, but hey, at least the actor is happily in a committed long-term relationship.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/08/actor-rocert-scott-wilson-and-his-girlfriend-janelle-faretra--1575793743.jpg width=450 height=436 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Actor Robert Scott Wilson and his girlfriend, Janelle Faretra. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rob Scott Wilson Instagram</span></strong><p>Robert and his potential future wife had been dating for quite a while by the time he made his relationship official to his fans on Instagram. And, at this point, you must be wondering about the identity of Miss Faretra.</p><p>Janelle Faretra is a professional makeup artist who has worked with top international brands and A-listers celebrities, including <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>'s BFF, aka <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>'s girlfriend, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sofia Ritchie</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a>. She even has more than 64.6k followers... and counting on her Instagram as of 2023.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/08/robert-wilson-and-girlfriend-janelle-has-been-together-since-2011--1575793832.jpg width=450 height=562 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Robert Wilson and his girlfriend Janelle have been together since 2011. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rob Scott Wilson Instagram</span></strong><p>And, one can't just deny how hot the couple looks together. Robert's fit and toned body and Janelle's perfect body and model face make a good pair.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did Rob meet Janelle?</h2><p>To be precise, Wilson and Faretra's relationship began at the end of 2011, and not long after that, their romance just blossomed. Even more precisely, the pair met when they had to share the same flight to Los Angeles.</p><p>But Robert knew about his then-future girlfriend through his friends, who were the ones to inform him about Janelle, with whom he was going to share the flight. Not to mention, Janelle was also moving into the same flat with his friends.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/08/rob-wilson-and-janelle-faretra-met-when-they-first-shared-a-flight-to-la-in-2011--1575793968.jpg width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rob Wilson and Janelle Faretra met when they first shared a flight to LA in 2011. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rob Scott Wilson Instagram</span></strong><p>Their first meet, however, wasn't what Wilson imagined it to be like when Faretra appeared to be 'standoffish' and rude. But, the misunderstanding cleared off soon when the makeup artist disclosed how embarrassed she was to meet an actor without makeup.</p><p>Yes, Janelle knew Robert's Hollywood status and even thought she would love to meet him. Janelle also hails from Boston, where the All My Children actor was born and raised. And, likewise, the rest is history.</p><p>On the other hand, considering that Janelle and her handsome beau have been lucky in love for more than seven years, fans can't stop but wonder if the couple might get engaged to be married anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>Of course, neither Rob nor his girlfriend has addressed the rumors yet. The two aren't married yet, let alone engaged. But isn't it obvious that the lovely couple will share the exciting news with their fans when it happens?</p><p><strong>View more romantic <a href=# rel=noopener>Gossip</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a> on your favorite Hollywood celebrities on <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyir9OoqWaqn5eys8CMrJqorKRixKq40qilZqqloryzscNmq6hlkpp6prrGmp6enF2pvG64zqeeZqyVp7pus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnJmqWepJyaeqet0Z6rq5k%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
