But every few years, usually after one balayage treatment too many, my Wet Brush ceases to effortlessly glide through and detangle my locks. This is when I am forced to bring in the big guns: Hydrating, thirst-quenching shampoos, conditioners, and other treatment products to nourish my dry locks back to health. Obviously, expensive treatments like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Olaplex’s $60 hair perfector</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">K18’s $75 repair mask</a> are on this list, but <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">there's one hydrating shampoo</a> that always gets the job done just as well — and it’s just $9 on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I first discovered <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Acure’s Ultra Hydrating Shampoo</a> about seven years ago on the shelves of my local Whole Foods store. My hair was super thirsty as it was in the middle of a brutal Chicago winter. I had just given birth to my second child, so I was also experiencing some serious post-pregnancy hair shedding. I was attracted to Acure, not only because of the price tag, but the fact that all their products were vegan and certified cruelty-free, and made without mineral oils, parabens, petroleum, and formaldehyde.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $9 (Originally $10); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brand’s hydrating shampoo <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">and conditioner</a> were my first purchases from the line. From the very first time I lathered the almond-y, sweet-smelling shampoo into my hair, I knew it was a keeper. After that initial wash, my unruly locks combed out a little easier, and once dried, were noticeably less frizzy and even shinier. Within a week, my hair felt significantly more hydrated. And after a few months, I noticed regrowth. Was this my imagination? According to science, probably not.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fatty acid-rich argan oil and pumpkin seed oil are two of the hottest essential oils for hair health. And guess what? The shampoo is formulated with both. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Studies show</a> that topical application of pumpkin seed oil can promote hair growth, while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">argan oil helps</a> maintain moisture and increase elasticity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Recently, after a balayage treatment left my hair once again feeling tangled, dry, and rats nest-y, I ordered another set of Acure’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ultra Hydrating Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Conditioner on Amazon</a>. And guess what? After the first shampoo and condition, my hair felt instantly hydrated. Recently, I started using it in my 7-year-old daughter’s hair, which is incredibly fine and prone to frizz and tangles, and have noticed an immediate improvement; it looks smoother, shinier, and overall, more manageable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t just take my word for it. “This is the best shampoo and conditioner I've used and I'm 64. It made my hair silky again and not dry after using another shampoo for years,” wrote one of the many <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon reviewers</a> just as obsessed as me. Another fan, who “struggled” with her “frizzy wavy/curly hair” ordered the shampoo after “feeling frustrated” of years trying other more expensive shampoos. “From the first wash, it was such a night and day difference! No frizz, just smooth, moisturized waves and curls,” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">she maintained</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other things I love about Acure? While I haven’t tried all of the brand’s products, the ones I have used never irritate my sensitive skin (I have a tendency to break out after using certain products) or weigh my hair down. Along with a shampoo and conditioner, Acure also makes an <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ultra Hydrating Body Wash</a> that has the same gloriously subtle scent as their haircare items. I suggest ordering all three — it will cost you less than a single bottle of shampoo from the salon.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wJysq51dqrm1vsBmn7KcopbBqrrGZqqhmZ2lvLB50Z6top2nYoRyhJZsbm4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
