No matter what hairstyle or fashion she rocked, though, the Ghost alum always looked incredible. To this day, she is just as beautiful as she was when she was young!</p><p>In order to maintain her natural glow, the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> nominee is all about taking care of her skin. “I moisturize, moisturize, moisturize,” she told <a href=#>Marie Claire</a> in July 2010. “No matter how late it is, when I get home, I take the time to clean and moisturize my face. I’m a big believer in that if you focus on good skincare, you really won’t need a lot of makeup.”</p><p>The Indecent Proposal actress is also one to try new skincare trends and treatments, including cryotherapy and Thermage skin-tightening. Demi revealed she once tried leech therapy, which is used to “improve circulation and prevent tissue death,” per <a href=#>Healthline</a>, during an appearance on <a href=#>Late Night with David Letterman</a> in 2008.</p><p>“I was in Austria doing a cleanse and part of the treatment was leech therapy,” she explained to host <a href=#><strong>David Letterman</strong></a> at the time. “These aren’t just swamp leeches though – we are talking about highly trained medical leeches.”</p><p>“These are not some low-level scavengers – we’re talking high-level bloodsuckers,” Demi emphasized, noting they attach to your body and release proteins and peptides that thin blood and prevent clotting. “It detoxifies your blood – I’m feeling very detoxified right now.”</p><p>Demi proved she was all about her beauty regimen when she debuted a youthful appearance while <a href=#>walking Fendi’s runway</a> during Paris Fashion Week in January 2021. The Striptease alum got emotional about the dream come true while talking with <a href=#><strong>Naomi Campbell</strong></a> in early February.</p><p>“I took a moment and I thought, ‘Oh my God, I just walked a runway show with some of the biggest models ever,'” Demi <a href=#>marveled</a>. “I literally felt like a little kid … it really was a teenage fantasy fulfilled.”</p><p>Reflecting on the unforgettable experience, Demi noted taking the runway was a “powerful” moment. “It felt special for me because it felt less that it was entirely about the clothes and more that it was about the full story,” she gushed. “It felt very magical and moving. It was extremely memorable.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Demi’s transformation through the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dnKahXaK8sL7EZrCorZ6cere%2FjKemsGWjmrJutMSrZK2qkaPAp7vRppitoZ%2Bjeqq6jKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
