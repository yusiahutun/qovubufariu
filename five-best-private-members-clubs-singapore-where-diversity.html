That's just exciting,” he says. “The club scene is simply the vehicle for these misfits to flourish.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From establishments with a rich history to recent arrivals, these are some of the Lion City’s best private members clubs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/54e739a2-ea76-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_972x_134324.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1. Straits Clan</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Conceived by Singaporean hospitality firm The Lo & Behold Group, Straits Clan was formed in 2018. Sitting tall on Bukit Pasoh Road, known for housing multiple clan associations in the 19th century (many of which are still there), the club occupies four storeys of an art deco, pre-war conservation building built in 1928.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For 11 years the property was the New Majestic Hotel, and today it still resembles an inviting upscale boutique hotel with its rattan furniture, geometric patterned tiles and pastel hues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As you move up from floor to floor, the colours get warmer and the tile patterns change, creating a clear division between the casual, formal, private and public spaces. There is a Tropicana-themed private entertainment area that elevates a dingy ’70s karaoke lounge into a snazzy space with sleek metallic finishing, plush seating, marbled cocktail tables and a pole dancing platform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our membership base is a diverse community of individuals united by curiosity, creative energy and entrepreneurial zeal, rather than profession, geography or economics,” says the co-founder Wee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Membership rates are lowered for those under the age of 30, as well as for those who are from the non-profit sector.

A 25 million-year-old rose quartz crystal – weighing 1.5 tonnes – greets guests at reception. Further in, you’ll find steampunk-inspired phone booths and a bar made out of 360 vintage teapots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the same vein as the out-of-this-world decor, members enjoy experiences money can’t buy. “For instance, we took 90 members and their immediate family to meet with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in March 2019,” says Nicholson, the founder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To be part of this elite group, you’re either invited to join or you can write to apply; members pay a one-time joining fee of S$5,000 and monthly fees at S$180.
