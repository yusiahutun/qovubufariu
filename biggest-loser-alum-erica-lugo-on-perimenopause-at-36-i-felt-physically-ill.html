However, the medication triggered alarming side effects.</p><p id=e8J3Nqpfzej9Q data-wc=24>Within days, she experienced suicidal ideation, a deeply troubling emotional state. Fearing for her well-being, Erica's husband, friends, and family rallied to support her.</p><p id=eYcFWngT0wn data-wc=47>Despite transitioning to an alternative medication, Lugo continued to grapple with severe emotional swings. She knew there was more to her suffering than anxiety and depression, as she had never encountered mental health issues before. Her symptoms escalated, affecting her ability to sleep, eat, and function normally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e0d8349e6e4-3186890956841860530963884651879863473162388n.jpg><p id=ekevtqbKsa3 data-wc=51>“My mood had changed so drastically,” she told the outlet. “Things were heavy, everything was dark, the sun was shining, but it wasn't. I wasn't sleeping. I was having three periods a month and spotting in between. I was sweating the bed seven days before my period. I was gaining weight.”</p><p id=e6tpgXYRcoV data-wc=50>Erica’s lowest point came around her December 2022 birthday when she no longer felt safe by herself. She sought comfort in the presence of loved ones, fearing the consequences of solitude. In a heart-wrenching moment, she confessed to her husband that she felt so erratic that she could contemplate self-harm.</p><p id=eXgO93ynGjl data-wc=34>She said: “One night with Danny I was like, ‘I feel really erratic right now, like I could go jump off a bridge. I don't want to, but I feel like I could.’ ”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/12a1a23f4b3a-342222193764535105248984355428219240157472n.jpg><p id=elP04SGMWzc data-wc=17>Desperate for solutions, her doctor suggested additional medications to counteract the side effects of her current treatment.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2d4dNm3G9e data-wc=36>Eventually, a therapist helped her recognize that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), exacerbated by Zoloft, was a significant factor in her distress. However, she remained convinced that hormonal imbalances played a crucial role in her mental health crisis.</p><p id=eIWX4WzM6Lk data-wc=44>Her suspicions led her to take a Dutch test, a home-based hormone assessment, due to her role as the owner of a functional health coaching company, T4E. The results revealed a stark reality: her progesterone levels were non-existent, and her testosterone levels were negligible.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehcyRsx_jA0 data-wc=23>At just 36 years old, Erica confronted the likelihood of perimenopause, despite this phase typically occurring between the ages of 40 and 58.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f87e320f664-3393285337648206716314018949871098232108065n.jpg><p id=eGF0rEiZcjH data-wc=41>Seeking validation of her diagnosis, Erica consulted her obstetrician-gynecologist, detailing her symptoms, which included mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, and erratic menstrual cycles. To her dismay, her doctor dismissed the possibility of perimenopause, citing her age as the primary reason.</p><p id=eWwKw-7BHNDo data-wc=37>Frustrated by the lack of validation, Erica persisted in her pursuit of answers. She secured a Dutch test through a nurse practitioner associated with her health coaching company. The results affirmed her suspicions—she was indeed in perimenopause.</p><p id=e-ezgkVl0RzG data-wc=29>With her diagnosis confirmed, Erica began hormone replacement therapy, a treatment she continues to this day. Gradually, she started to experience improvement in her mental health and overall well-being.</p><p id=eR9WOXppVqOE data-wc=46>By April 2023, her condition had significantly improved. She found a healthcare provider who genuinely listened to her concerns and worked collaboratively to address her needs. Complementing her hormone therapy, Erica incorporates natural supplementation suggested by her health coach and closely monitors her female sex hormones.</p><p id=eFM9vWa3_nsg data-wc=40>Nevertheless, one issue remained unresolved: weight gain. Erica, who had undergone a remarkable transformation, shedding 160 pounds before her role as a trainer on The Biggest Loser, found that her hormonal changes required a shift in her approach to fitness.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Carol Vorderman says she was suicidal during the menopause in candid interview</figure><p id=eOQPsQn9mixC data-wc=62>She realized that her previous high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routines and rigorous muscle-building workouts were no longer effective. To accommodate her changing hormonal profile, she incorporated more low-impact, steady-state cardio exercises, such as walking and swimming. These activities facilitate fat burning without inducing cortisol spikes. She continues to engage in weightlifting sessions 3 to 4 times a week to maintain muscle tone.</p><p id=eOmGs14Iczqj data-wc=74>Reflecting on her journey, Erica acknowledges her body's evolving needs and is content with her current weight, which has increased by 15 to 20 pounds since her time on The Biggest Loser. “I don't want to be stuck in that box anymore because that's not me anymore,” she said. “I know now that the older we get, the more we have to pay attention to our bodies and work with them, versus against them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45uZ2pwY2t8o7XGoJysrF2hvLSx0WaYpa2dYrKztcKaZKWtl6R6sLqMqZyroZ2au7C8wK6qnmWRqXp0goyiZJ%2BdnKl6sbTYrKCcmZyhxm61y6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
