"It was like a day, two days after he died. We were at an Airbnb in L.A. and all of a sudden the TV turns on ... and it wouldn't stop."</p><p>"We tried disconnecting it and all this," he continued. "Then we turned it off and then it came back on and I was just like, 'This is weird. It gives me chills.' I don't know."</p><p>Malone also expressed that he and Miller had discussed creating an album together.</p><p>"We were sitting there playing beer pong and we were like, 'Let's make a f--king album.' Then we were coming up with names."</p><p>He added of Miller, "What an incredible, honestly, what a genuine human being."</p><p>The "Wow" singer also recalled the beginning of his friendship with the late rapper.</p><p>"Mac was the first artist to get me," Malone said. "Mac was the first one that tweeted me. "It's so weird because I listened to him since the beginning. I was like, 'Yeah, awesome. This guy's cool as shit.' Then to be able to meet him and become friends with him was just like, 'I look up to you, and now we're sitting here playing beer pong.'"</p><p>Last September, Miller died at the age of 26 after an accidental overdose. He was found inside his San Fernando Valley home and pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Malone was one of the many of the celebrities who paid tribute to the "Self Care" singer after he died.</p><p>"God f--king dammit. You were such an incredible person," he wrote on Twitter after hearing the news. "You changed so many lives. Had so much love in your heart. You inspired me throughout highschool, and I wouldn't be where I was today without you. Never a more kind and sincere and beautiful person. I f--king love you mac."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:28101393-f2f4-5c33-a7f3-0df841df06c5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:88d4069b-b5d7-5351-aafe-e41e6463ddd1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/5by4/2019/07/09/5f6adda8a4f85c06b26348d06837055e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Annie Leibovitz/Vogue</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Grande Was 'So Drunk' in the Studio for 'Thank U, Next' She Can't Remember Recording It</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Earlier this week, shortly before the one-year anniversary of Miller's death, the man who allegedly supplied Miller with the fentanyl-laced pills that contributed to his accidental overdose <a href=#><strong>was arrested</strong></a>.</p><p>28-year-old Cameron James Pettit was taken into custody Wednesday for allegedly supplying Miller with counterfeit oxycodone pills that contained fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that's 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine.</p><p>Per the 42-page criminal complaint, obtained by <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a>, federal prosecutors claim the rapper had asked Pettit for "percs" -- short for Percocet, a brand-name prescription painkiller that contains acetaminophen and oxycodone -- and that Pettit allegedly ended up supplying Miller with the deadly knockoff pills instead.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
